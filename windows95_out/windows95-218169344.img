Netscape software has the built-incapability to read HTML-formatted pages (as well as the GIF, JPEG,and XBM graphic file formats). Netscape can interpret many other fileformats with the help of external helper applications. To accommodatethe file formats requiring helper applications, Netscape keeps amapping of file formats to helper applications.<P>MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standardized methodfor organizing divergent file formats. The method organizes fileformats according to the file's MIME type. When Netscape softwareretrieves a file from a server, the server provides the MIME type ofthe file. Netscape uses the MIME type to establish whether the fileformat can be read by the software's built-in capabilities or, ifnot, whether a suitable helper application is available to read thefile.<P>For servers that do not provide a MIME type with a file, Netscapeinterprets the file's extension (a suffix appended to a file name).For example, the <b>.html</b> extension in the file name<b>index.html</b> suggests a file in the HTML format. Likewise, a<b>.zip</b> extension suggests a compressed file, an <b>.rtf</b>extension suggests a file in the Rich Text Format, and so on. You canview and configure the mapping of all MIME types to helperapplications by using the <b>General|Helpers</b> panel. (On UNIX,edit your global or personal MIME types file whose pathname isdesignated.)<P>Note that the panel currently lacks a <b>Delete</b> buttonand the ability to assign arbitrary values to file types. If needed,advanced users might want to edit the preferences file directly.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C30"><b>What are MIME, Types files, and Mailcap files?</b></A><P>The MIME protocol is used in Internet communications to transmitdocuments of varying formats. The protocol handles complexities byestablishing a relationship (a mapping) between the format of adocument's content and the format of the document's computerrepresentation. Applications using MIME can establish the type ofsoftware necessary to interpret the content of a transmitteddocument. With the proper Helper Application settings and software,Netscape can automatically initiate the necessary actions to provideyou access to content transmitted in numerous formats.<P>On Windows and Macintosh, the mapping of MIME types is handled in the<b>General|Helpers</b> panel. On UNIX, the mapping of MIME types usestwo kinds of files: a Types file and a Mailcap file (each can beconfigured with global, default, and personal files).<P>A Types file maps a file format (on the left) with an identifyingfile name suffix (on the right). Here's a sample from a<b>.mime.types</b> file:<PRE>   application/dvi  dvi   image/jpeg  jpeg   audio/basic  au, wav</PRE>  <P>A Mailcap file maps a file format (on the left) with a softwareapplication capable interpreting the format (on the right). Here's asample from a <b>.mailcap</b> file:<PRE>   application/dvi; dvi-app-name %s   image/*; xv %s   audio/basic; audiotool %s</PRE><P>As an example, an audio file <b>mySound.au</b> plays using the<b>audiotool</b> application.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C31"><b>Where can I learn about Internet security?</b></A><P>The Internet security technology developed by Netscape Communicationsto ensure private and authenticated communications (called SSL, shortfor Secure Sockets Layer protocol) is an open platform put into thepublic domain for the Internet community. Netscape Navigator andNetscape's secure servers offer this nonproprietary technology.Choose the <b>Help|On Security</b> menu item for an overview ofsecurity implementation from Netscape Communications and aspecification for the Secure Sockets Layer protocol.<P>The introductory information in the Netscape Navigator
