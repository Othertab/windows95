interpreted by separate applications. Netscape maintains a directoryof helper applications that you ought to have on your disk drive.When you click on a link that requires outside help, Netscape makesthe helper application automatically run.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C12"><FONT SIZE=+3>P</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ages you can write on</FONT></A><P>I noticed some pages have blanks for you to fill in.<P>That's right, Dad. Pages can contain forms. Forms can accept inputand, with the press of a button, transmit the input to an electronicaddress.<P>So what you have is a page with a place inside for the user to writeemail.<P>Essentially, yes, though forms can take different kinds of input.Forms may contain check boxes, radio buttons, pull-down menus, orselection lists. Sometimes you'll find fields already filled in withsuggested text. When you are finished filling out a form, you sendit. Usually you just have to press a button because the email addressof the recipient is predetermined by the form.<P>What happens to the form after you send it out to the Internet?<P>The input gets sent, not the form. The information you entered istransmitted to a mailbox for a person to read or to a computercapable of interpreting, and perhaps responding to, your input. Aform that produces an immediate response is common. Such a formrequests information that goes back to a server computer, the serverinterprets the information you've entered on the form, then sendsback to you a page with information responding to your request. Butnot all forms send back mail. Sometimes when you send a form, noresponse is generated; the page with the form stays on your screenand the fields may revert to their original state.<P>This whole business of forms sounds like an easy way for anorganization to take orders or get customer feedback or disseminateinformation.<P>Just like paper forms, electronic forms provide a structure andcontext for communicating information. When you're communicating to acomputer, this can translate to fast and expansive responses. Formsare definitely cool.<P>I'd like to see a real estate form where you enter in the address ofa property for sale and you get back county clerk's records for thehouse. You know how the realtors alway use flowery language to make ahouse sound better than it is. Like cute instead of tiny. Like neartransportation instead of abutting a truck stop. The glossy brochurethat says "located atop a gently sloping hill" might appeal lessafter an Internet search reveals that the previous occupant's Andeangoat plummeted following a faulty misstep.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C13"><FONT SIZE=+3>S</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>peaking of goats</FONT></A><P>Do you think Netscape and the Internet are important in the grandscheme of things?<P>Martha. You know what happens when we start talking existentially.<P>The same as when we play crazy eights. Followed by an uncanny hungerfor a mushroom pizza.<P>Knowledge transfers more deliberately than computer bits. My fondnessof the Internet is strongest when I get the sense I've enteredsomeone else's mind. Institutionalized information doesn't appeal tome like the clever, intimate home pages of people expressing a smallpart of themselves. The Internet lets you publish a portrait ofyourself as you choose, a freedom that printed pages or broadcastmedia can't grant efficiently. Netscape makes the Internet lessdaunting. Mostly by consolidating the different protocols ofelectronic information, and also by offering built-in “schoolsupplies” like bookmark links that let you organize your ownrepository. The combination of heartfelt content and personalizedtools makes a worthwhile contribution. I certainly find the work morerewarding than my primary task in the Tenderloin: coercingintoxicated patrons to refrain from fondling the florescentappendages of a fourteen-foot ceramic Lizzie Borden.<P>Remember when we visited the little farm in Tilden park and youtalked to the Saint Albans goat?<P>Everyone
