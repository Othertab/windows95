ngthe <b>Go|Stop Loading</b> menu item.<p>An unfollowed link is a connection to a page that you have not yetviewed; a followed link is one you have. By default, unfollowed linksare blue and followed links are purple. (On Windows and Macintosh,you can change the colors used to denote unfollowed and followedlinks from the <b>Options|General|Colors</b> menu item. On UNIX,modify your .Xdefaults file outside of the application.) If you havea black and white monitor, unfollowed and followed links arehighlighted only with underlining and not differentiated.<p>You can stop a transfer in progress whenever the transfer takes longerthan you like. This might happen if the content of the page is largeor if the server computer is sluggish. Sometimes the page specifiedby a link  just isn't available. You'll usually get a message if aconnection was not made or a page not found. Examine the status fieldand progress bar to receive feedback about the progress of atransfer.<p>When you bring a page to your screen, you'll see the whole page or, ifthe content is extensive, only a portion. (Scroll bars let you seethe rest.) Often the portion you see is the beginning of the page,but sometimes a link brings you content from the page's middle orend. A link can display a new page or display a different portion ofthe same page (in effect, automatically scrolling for you). Forexample, the beginning of a page might include a table of contentsthat links each chapter title to its respective content further downthe page.<P>Yet another kind of link doesn't bring a page at all. A <b>mailto</b>link whose URL begins with <b>mailto:</b>, produces the Message Compositionwindow for sending email (with the recipient's address automaticallyfilled in).<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C4"><FONT SIZE=+3>L</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>inking via buttons and menuitems</FONT></A><P>In addition to links in the content area, you can also access linksusing Netscape buttons and menu items. Many of the links controlledby buttons and menu items bring pages you have viewed at least oncebefore. Button links are particularly useful for going back and forthamong recently viewed pages. Menu item links directly access a widerange of pages such as a history list of pages you have viewed or abookmark list of pages you (or others) have personally selected asnoteworthy.<p>The toolbar offers the following button links:<ul><li><b>Back</b> displays the previous page in the history list. Thehistory list is a reference to pages you have viewed.<li><b>Forward</b> displays the next page in the history list.(Available only after using the <b>Back</b> command or a history menuitem.)<li><b>Home</b> displays the home page designated in yourpreferences.<li><b>Open</b> displays a dialog box where you can enter any URL.</ul><p>Once you have brought a page to screen, you can view (and store, ifyou wish) its URL. Every page is distinguished by its URL. Linking toa page via highlighted content, toolbar buttons, or menu items is ashortcut that enables you to display the page without having toexplicitly request the page's URL. When no built-in link isavailable, you can display a page by entering the URL in the locationfield, then pressing the Enter (Return) key. (The label of thelocation field changes to <b>Go to</b> when you edit the field.)Alternatively, you can choose the <b>File|Open Location</b> menuitem, enter the URL in the dialog box, then press the <b>Open</b>button.<p>Menu items offer each of the links available through toolbar buttonsplus many more. The Netscape application keeps track of pages youhave seen, lets you create easy-access lists of favorite pages, andpoints you to pages with current information about Netscape and theInternet. The page's title is displayed as the menu item.<ul><li>History items from the <b>Go</b> menu display previously viewedpages. The Netscape application automatically appends the title of apage you have viewed as the topmost menu item in the history list.The <b>View History</b> me
