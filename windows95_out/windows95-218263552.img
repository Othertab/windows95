s worldwide that are connected in one way or another. It's anetwork. No one owns the whole thing. It's more a collaboration amongall kinds of organizations and people to split the cost andresponsibilities of sharing information.<P>I suppose everyone who wants to can broadcast from their own hometelevision station.<P>Sort of. Right now you can publish the equivalent of interactivemagazine pages. The broadcast of sound and movies is becoming moreand more efficient.<P>We'll need a remote control that can flip through several millionstations. And they better not forget the on and off switch.<P>So I think you and Mom ought to try using Netscape. I can get youconnected to the Internet on your computer at home. Then you canbrowse around to see what interests you.<P>Don't have much time for the computer these days. Am volunteering atthe hospital two days a week and the library one day week. Help outat the USO Wednesday evenings. Play golf. Keep the house up. Takeyour mother out to dinner. When I need to write something down, Ifind it easier to pick up a pen.<P>Just try it, Dad. This isn't a crummy word processor that gives youempty pages and a thick manual. With Netscape, your pages are filledwith information on topics you choose. Pages with color pictures andnice text and maybe sounds or movies.<P>Yes, I know. Computers are the future. Show your mother how it works.She's better than I am. She can make the toasters swim with thecolored fish.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C3"><FONT SIZE=+3>R</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>andom access page-turner</FONT></A><P>Here, Ma. I set everything up for you. You're looking at the Netscapehome page. To go somewhere, just point the mouse over any coloredtext and click. You can always come back to where you were byclicking on the <b> Back </b> button in this toolbar or selecting<b>Back</b> from the <b>Go</b> menu. See these words <ahref="../index.htm">Netscape Handbook</a>? That's the book I'mworking on. Try clicking on it. Go on. Just point and click. That'sright. Now see the colors moving on this little indicator image. Thatmeans the page you clicked on is being transferred from a remotecomputer to your computer. Same thing with this status bar and thesemessages in the status area. They are all feedback to tell you howinformation you requested is coming from a server computer through anInternet connection to your computer.<P>So I'm on the information highway. This is fun. How come your book isonly one page long?<P>There's more, Ma. You're just looking at the title and the table ofcontents. Netscape brings you one page at a time. I could have putthe whole book in one long scrolling page but it's more efficient totransport documents in smaller chunks. Maybe some people want to readonly the fun, folksy part. This way they can click on <ahref="intro.htm#C0">heartwarming introduction</a> to receivejust the section they want rather than the whole book.<P>I can't wait to read it, but I need to get my glasses. Sometimes I geta headache trying to read on the screen. You wouldn't have a printedcopy, would you?<P>Yeah, I've got a printed copy. Netscape lets you change the size andkind of text you see on screen, yet still I don't like reading longdocuments on screen. I just want to show you how you can click oncertain words that are linked automatically to a new page. Click onany of the highlighted words in the table of contents or index, andyou'll see the page that is linked. Netscape works like a televisionremote control except instead of channels you select pages. It's anautomatic, random access page-turner.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C4"><FONT SIZE=+3>S</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ister</FONT></A><P>Hi Tooey. Ma says you took her for a ride on the information highway.<P>Yeah, but she wasn't wearing her glasses so she didn't see anything.<P>She said she had a good time.<P>I showed her how Netscape software works. It's pretty simple: you runthe program while connected to the Internet and you look at pages,som
