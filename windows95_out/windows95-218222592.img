age is a connection to relatedinformation I might wish to explore next."<p>Netscape's popularity stems from the opulence of its pages and theease of bringing them to your screen. Pages designed with expressivelettering, art, color, photos, sound, animation, forms, andinteractivity can be linked to an untold number of similar pagesdistributed on networked computers worldwide.<p>Some Netscape pages contain frames. Frames segment a page intorectangular areas, each area capable of displaying a page. Usingframes, Netscape can display pages within a page (like thepicture-in-picture feature of TV sets). Clicking on a link in a framemay bring one or more new frames within a page, or an entirely newpage. The author of a page determines which frames make up a page,however, you can use your mouse to resize any frame within a page sothat you have control over the layout of the presented information.<p>Netscape explores World Wide Web pages, a part of the Internet rich inmultimedia features, as well as other parts of the Internet that areoften text-based. The Internet's Usenet newsgroups, electronic mail,and alternative transport protocols offer impressive diversity ofcontent and communicative prowess. To take advantage of this wealth,Netscape software contains features to explore the Internet innumerous domains.<p>Foremost, Netscape software presents pages of the Internet withelegance and efficiency. Netscape software is a browser--aninterface--to pages throughout the world. Netscape software allowsyou to immerse yourself in content unencumbered by the complexity ofdistributed networks.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C2"><FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>here should I start?</FONT></A><P>Netscape software makes your exploration of the Internet moreproductive and efficient.
