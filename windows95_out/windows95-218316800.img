age</b> option active.<p>You also have the option of displaying an image incrementally as theimage is transmitted or in a single burst after the transmission.Typically, the <b>While Loading</b> option provides more satisfyingfeedback. However, on a fast network, the <b>After Loading</b> optionmay complete the load slightly faster.<p>To set this option, choose the <b>Options|General|Images</b> menuitem, then select one of the two radio buttons: <b>While Loading</b>or <b>After Loading</b>.<p>Like highlighted text, an inline image can be linked to another page,another position on the same page, or any type of external file suchas an external image. As with all links, pointing the mouse buttonover a link puts the URL location of the prospective link in thestatus field.<p><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C10"><FONT SIZE=+3>V</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>iewing external images</FONT></A><P>External images (unlike inline images) are displayed in their ownwindows. You can view an external image by clicking on a link to theimage. The Netscape application can open external images stored inGIF (Graphics Interchange Format), JPEG (Joint Photographic ExpertsGroup), and XBM (X Bit Map) file formats. Other file formats requirethat you have a suitable helper application available on your harddisk (and referenced in the <b>Helpers</b> panel).<P>Links to external images work like links to pages. An external imagefile has a unique URL just like an ordinary page. External images arenot automatically loaded in their full representation even if the<b>Auto Load Images</b> item is checked.<P>You can click on highlighted text, an image icon, or an inline imageto bring an external image into a separate window on the screen.Netscape or the external application opens and presents the image ina separate window. You must click back into the Netscape window tocontinue working with the Netscape application.<P>Pages that present large or detailed images often have inline snapshotimages (also called thumbnail images) inserted into pages that serveas links to external images. Unlike the icon replacements, thesesnapshots provide an approximate view of the actual image, yet arestill much smaller and faster to transport than the full image. Youcan expand the snapshot into the full image by clicking once on thesnapshot.<p><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C11"><FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>illing in forms</FONT></A><P>You can do more than read Netscape pages; you can write on them. Pagescan contain forms for you to enter and send information. For example,a page might have a form with fields for you to enter a name andaddress next to a button that sends the information to the page'sauthor. Forms can offer editable fields with or without default text,check boxes, radio buttons, pull-down menus, selection lists, andbuttons to send or clear the information you enter. The content youenter into a form doesn't permanently alter the page (you don'tmodify the source page at its location), yet the form gives you theability to conveniently transmit a response.<P>To send ordinary email, you fill in fields to supply the content ofyour message, the subject summary, and the email address of theintended recipient. Pages with forms let you reply to information youread in the page. To send a form, you fill in one or more fieldsembedded within a page, usually labeled with instructions andconfigured with a button that sends the form's contents to therecipient without requiring you to provide any email address.<P>The author of a page determines the layout of a form. A page cancontain multiple forms, each form capable of sending fieldsindependently of another form on the page. Fields in a form canrestrict the kind or range of text you enter (such as numbers only)to help you fill in the form as desired.<P>Typically, forms give you a fast and easy way to make a request orsend back a response regarding the page you are reading. Forms cansupply an interface to databases with fields that let you que
