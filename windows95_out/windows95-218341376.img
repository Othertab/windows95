For example, the URL <b>news:alt.tv.northern-exp</b>specifies the server protocol <b>news:</b> and the newsgroup<b>alt.tv.northern-exp</b>. Unlike other Internet connections, theURL does not specify a server name and pathname with precedingslashes.<P>Each newsgroup has a unique name, described with words separated byperiods. Some words (like <b>alt</b>, short for alternative, or<b>comp</b>, short for computers) specify categories rather than aparticular newsgroup. Note that not all news servers provide accessto all newsgroups.<P>Reading Usenet news can be as easy as reading any other Internet page:Click on a link and bring a Usenet news message to your screen. Butnewsgroup pages offer advantages (notably the ability to easilypublish your own writing to other newsgroup readers) anddisadvantages (no images, weak formatting, and limited links).<P>Typically, each newsgroup presents its messages along threads. Athread bundles a message with a response to the message. The groupingof a new topic with one or more responses to the topic (in indentedoutline form) presents messages in a topical context. A strictlychronological organization of every newsgroup contribution wouldcreate a discombobulated trail of messages less pleasant than readingJoyce in his later years.<P>When you subscribe to a newsgroup, the name of the newsgroup is addedto a list (a News file; also called a News RC or newsrc file),maintained by the Netscape software. On Windows and UNIX, you canspecify the location of your News file in the Servers panel. OnMacintosh, the News file is stored in the Netscape folder within yoursystem's Preferences folder.<P>The process for retrieving information from news servers has asignificant difference than the process for retrieving informationfrom World Wide Web servers. News messages are collected andautomatically distributed at periodic intervals, en masse, among newsservers throughout the Usenet. When you supply a URL to requestnewsgroup messages, your request is routed to the news serverprovided by your service provider, which has accumulated messagesthroughout the Usenet system. In contrast, when you supply a URL torequest a particular Web page, your request is routed to the singleWeb site whose server distributes the page.<P>Likewise, a news message that you send goes to your service provider'snews server, whereupon the message is automatically distributed atperiodic intervals to other participating Usenet news servers. OtherUsenet readers can then access your news message from their localnews server.<P>This batch processing of Usenet news permits distributionefficiencies. For example, a popular Web site can get inundated withrequests for pages. However, a popular newsgroup is broadlydistributed by the entire network of participating news servers.<P>Your request for either Web pages or news messages contains someidentifying information about the requesting computer. With Webpages, request information is conveyed to Web site that serves apage. With news, request information is conveyed to your provider'snews server.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C19"><FONT SIZE=+3>S</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>aving pages</FONT></A><P>Netscape software gives you the opportunity to save a page as a fileon your computer. You can do this after or instead of bringing thepage to your screen.<p>Some links, for example those that transport software, sound, or moviefiles, don't transmit pages. You can often identify these links bynoticing a URL that begins with <b>ftp</b> or ends with a file-typesuffix such as <b>au</b> or <b>mpeg</b>. Clicking on these links canaut
