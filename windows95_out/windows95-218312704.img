mmodate thecharacter symbols of numerous languages. You can view or modify thefonts associated with any encoding by choosing the encoding name fromthe menu, then choosing items from the proportional and fixed fontpull-down menus. For example, for the default encoding Latin1, youcan choose to display proportional font text in 12 point Times andfixed font text in 10 point Courier. Note that to apply a particularencoding to a page, choose from the <b>Options|Document Encoding</b>hierarchical menu.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C8"><FONT SIZE=+3>S</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>electing a home page</FONT></A><P>You can designate your own home page (the page the Netscapeapplication first brings to the screen each time you open a newwindow) by supplying a URL as a preferences panel item. The home pagedesignated initially with Netscape software (the default) has thisURL: <b>http://home.netscape.com/index.html</b> <p>You can change your home page (and change back to the default)clicking the radio button <b>Home Page Location</b> in<b>Options|General|Appearance</b>, then typing the URL of the newhome page you want. Alternatively, you can check the radio button<b>Blank Page</b> if you want the home page to be empty of content.<p>Each time you ask the Netscape application to open a new window, thedesignated home page is brought to screen. The URL can designate apage from a remote computer or one on your hard disk.<p>To get the URL of a page on your hard disk, choose <b>File|OpenFile</b>. Then select the page (file) on your hard disk (for example,you can choose your bookmarks file). After the page opens, you'll seeits URL in the location field. You can select and copy the URL, thenpaste it into the <b>Home Page Location</b> text field in yourpreferences.<p>At first, you probably won't have any pages stored on your hard disk.But later, you might want quick and sure access to certain pages, suchas one with valuable links or one you've created for yourself.<p><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C9"><FONT SIZE=+3>V</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>iewing inline images</FONT></A><P>Ideally, pages on the screen should present images (or othermultimedia effects) as simply and efficiently as text. However,images (and sounds and movies) are relatively larger in byte sizethan text and can take considerable time to transport from remotecomputers (servers) to your computer. The length of time needed tobring a page with images depends on several factors, most prominentlythe speed of the modem or direct link connecting you with a remoteserver. To compensate for the potential lethargy of transmittingimages, Netscape software offers features that let you manipulate howimages are handled.<p>The Netscape application loads images into pages automatically. If theauthor of a page has designed the page with inline images, the imagesare displayed when you bring the page to your screen. You have theoption to turn off automatic image loading by unchecking the<b>Options|Auto Load Images</b> menu item. When this menu item isunchecked, the images in pages are replaced by small icons. Inaddition, the small replacement icon is sometimes accompanied byalternative text. Also called ALT text, alternative text is shownonly as a substitution when an image is not loaded.<P>You can view these images at a later time. To manually load all imagesthat are represented by icons, you can press the <b>Images</b> buttonin the toolbar or select the <b>View|Load Images</b> menu item. Tomanually load an individual image, click on the image's icon.<p>The advantage of unchecking <b>Auto Load Images</b> is that pages arebrought to screen faster. The disadvantage is that you can't view theimages until you specify that you want the images loaded.<p>The <b>Auto Load Images</b> item affects subsequent links and not thecurrent contents of a page. However, if you choose the<b>View|Reload</b> menu item or press the <b>Reload</b> button on thetoolbar, you bring the current page back again, this time with the<b>Auto Load Im
