etrieves any new mail. To receive mail, you'll have to enter youremail password each session (or specify in the <b>Mail andNews|Organization</b> panel that your password be remembered acrosssessions).<P>After Netscape has initially checked the mail server for messages,Netscape can periodically recheck the server and inform you if anynew messages have arrived. However, Netscape does not automaticallyretrieve these additional messages from the mail server. To retrievenew messages, press the <b>Get Mail</b> toolbar button or click themail icon.<P>A setting in the <b>Mail and News|Servers</b> panel determines howoften Netscape automatically checks the mail server for new messages.You can also click on the mail icon from the Mail window to manuallycheck the server and retrieve new messages.<P>Netscape informs you of the availability of new messages using themail icon.<ul><li>Before you've checked for mail (for example, before you've openedthe Mail window or if you haven't supplied your password), you'll seea question mark (?) adjacent to the envelope. This indicates Netscapecannot automatically check the status of the mail server.<li>After you've check for mail, you'll see the envelope alone. Thisindicates there are no new messages for you.<li>Subsequently, when Netscape automatically checks the mail serverand finds new messages for you, you'll see an exclamation point (!)adjacent to the envelope. This indicates that new messages areavailable for retrieval. On Macintosh, you'll also be notified of newmessages by a mail icon flashing in the menu bar.</ul>The Mail window contains three panes: a mailbox pane, a message headerpane, and a message pane. Click on an item in the mailbox pane (suchas the Inbox) to display the mailbox contents in the message headerpane. Click on an item in the message header field to display themessage contents in the message pane.<P>Occasionally, you'll want to select multiple message headings, forexample, to move messages to the trash. To select multiple,contiguous message headings, hold down the Shift key as you click onan item. To select multiple, noncontiguous message headings, holddown the Ctrl key as you click on an item. (On Macintosh, use theShift key to select noncontiguous items). When two or more messageheadings are selected, the message pane is empty.<P>The Mail window and the Message Composition window, described insubsequent sections, contain menu items, toolbar buttons, andclickable icons to let you compose, view, organize, store, anddeliver your mail in varied ways. Menu items offer the full set offeatures. Toolbar buttons provide basic mail features such as gettingmail, deleting mail, composing mail, replying to mail, and displayingyour messages. Small, clickable icons in the message header pane letyou highlight individual messages as read or unread, and flagged orunflagged.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C14"><FONT SIZE=+3>U</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>sing the Mail window</FONT></A><P>The mailbox pane and message header pane are organized in columns.Columns in the mailbox pane state a mail folder name, the number ofunread messages it contains, and the total number of messages itcontains.

You can also use the <b>View|Sort</b>hierarchical menu to sort or thread messages so that replies arepositioned adjacent to original messages.
