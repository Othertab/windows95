ConsultNetscape's online pages to learn how to take advantage of thesefeatures. Consult Netscape's online pages to learn how to takeadvantage of these features.<P>One feature you'll certainly want to use is the HTML link. Here'san example of HTML that creates a link for users to click on:<P><PRE>   &lt;A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/A&gt;</PRE><P>The section between quotes is the page's URL you'll see when you clickon the link. The text following the URL contains the highlighted text(Home) the user sees on screen. The tag coding and brackets are alsoa required part of the link.<P>The method to insert images in your pages in very similar to that ofinserting links. Inline images are links to image files. To see anyone page's HTML source, you can choose the <b>View|DocumentSource</b> menu item. This command displays the text and tags used tocreate the content and content style of the current page.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C6"><b>How does the News area work?</b></A><P>Before you can use news for the first time you need to configureNetscape to point to your Usenet news server. Set the host name ofyour news (NNTP) server in the <b>Mail and News|Servers</b> panel. Yournewsgroup subscription information is stored in a News file. If youhave no previous News file, Netscape creates one that lists a coupleof newsgroups designed for new users.<P>By default, news messages are displayed in a threaded format. Thethreaded format groups all messages that are related to each other ina compact, ordered listing. Messages that are responses to previousmessages are nested under the parent messages.<P><b>Newsgroup pane</b>: shows a listing of the news servers and Usenetgroups currently available. Click on a newsgroup to display itsmessages in the message heading pane.<P>Settings in the <b>Options</b> menu let you change the newsgroups yousee in the pane. You can subscribe to newsgroups by first showing allnewsgroups, then clicking a particular newsgroup's Subscribe icon (acheck mark) in the pane. After subscribing to newsgroups you want,you can change the <b>Options</b> menu setting so that you view onlysubscribed newsgroups. (An active newsgroup is a subscribed newsgroupwith unread messages.) Other columns in the newsgroup pane tell youthe number of unread messages and the total number of messages pernewsgroup.<P>The leftmost folders in the newsgroup pane show the news servers (newshosts) you've connected to. You'll have only one folder here ifyou've connected to the default news server only. You'll have morethan one folder if you've connected to multiple news servers.<P><b>Message heading pane</b>: shows a list of a selected newsgroup'smessages. Click on a message heading to display its content in themessage pane.<P><b>Message content pane</b>: shows a single message. The message cancontain links to other messages or Internet pages.<P>Use the toolbar or menu items to display the Message Compositionwindow for replying to a message or posting a new message. You canalso use the Message Composition window to reply by email to themessage sender.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C7"><b>How do you create cascading (hierarchical) bookmark menus?</b></A><P><OL><li>Choose the <b>Window|Bookmarks</b> menu item to view theBookmarks window.<li>Click on the icon above where you want to position a new folder.Each folder represents a level (header) in a cascading (hierarchical)pull-down menu.<li>Choose <b>Item|Insert Folder</b>, type a title in the <b>Name</b>field, and click <b>OK</b> to create a new folder.<li>Drag and drop any bookmark icon on top of the new folder (orselect the folder, choose the <b>Insert Bookmark</b> menu item, andenter a name and URL).</OL><P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C8"><b>How do you convert hotlists to bookmarks?</b></A><P>Other brow
