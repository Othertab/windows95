If you don't know the name of yournews server, contact the service or administrator providing you withyour Internet connection. Text in the <b>News (NNTP) Server</b> fielddesignates the host name for the default news server.<p>The <b>News Directory</b> text field details the location of newsgroupsubscription and information files. A news file is maintained foreach news server you connect to (not on Macintosh; news files are inthe System Folder|Preferences|Netscape folder).<p>The last field on this panel, <b>Get 100 Messages at a Time</b>, canbe replaced with a number (up to 3500) that limits how many newsmessages are initially transferred, in a single block, from the newsserver. The larger the number, the longer it takes to complete thetransfer of each block of messages. Messages with more recent datesare transferred first. Messages with older dates can be transferredin blocks by clicking on links available at the start of a messagelisting.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C11"><FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ail and</FONT><FONT SIZE=+3>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ews Preferences</FONT><FONT SIZE=+3>|I</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>dentity</FONT></A><P>In the Mail section of this panel, enter your name and email addressin their respective fields so others can easily identify you andreply to your mail.
