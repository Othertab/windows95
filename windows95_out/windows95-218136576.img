In thismanner, you can have a fully capable web browser inserted into yourdocuments or spreadsheets. Likewise, Netscape, acting as an OLEcontainer, can display an application such as Wordpad or Excelprovided that the page's HTML uses the EMBED tag to designate theembedded server document.<P>A OLE server can be activated in place. Thus, when you activate(double-click) the OLE object, the object remains stationary andfunctions within the application (not spawning a new window). OLEservers also have the capability to be mini servers (for OLE 1compatibility). When you activate a mini-server in your containerdocument, the native application is activated and functions in a newwindow. Most OLE 2 containers, including Netscape, can be made to actas an OLE 1 container by holding down the Ctrl key anddouble-clicking the embedded OLE object.<P>OLE servers, when activated in place, take over the user interface oftheir host. For example, if you create a Word document, insert aNetscape object, then double-click on the embedded Netscapeapplication, the Word toolbar is replaced with the Netscape toolbarand the Word menus change to display the relevant Netscape menus.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C12"><b>What is autoscroll and how does it support chat?</b></A><P>Autoscroll is a feature of Netscape that lets a server deliver ongoingpage information to your screen automatically. The connection to theserver is kept open and new page information is appended. Theautoscroll areas (a page or page frame) automatically scrolls toaccommodate the data stream. Both autoscroll and server push leavethe connection to the server open and display new content on anongoing basis; however, autoscroll appends new information to the pagewhereas server push updates the entire page. You can close theconnection by bringing a new page.<P>The autoscroll feature can support an online chat sessionwith another user. You can view incoming text automatically withouthaving to use the scroll bar to move down the page. You can alsooutput text at the same time in an adjacent window withoutinterrupting the incoming text stream.<P>To implement the autoscroll feature, page creators and serveradministrators use Netscape's autoscrolling tool. Autoscroll is anHTTP header attribute. The content-type modifier AUTOSCROLL issimilar to CHARSET.<P>As new text arrives into the autoscroll area, the text scrolls to keepthe most recent line of transmitted text on the screen. You canscroll up to view previous text without having to watch the textstream, and can scroll down to again view the incoming stream. Theautoscroll area can display a maximum of 1000 lines and consists oftwo components:<ul><li>A Telnet-like window where text can scroll in and the most recenttext is displayed.<li>One or more text input areas that can send data (includinggraphics) to a server without interrupting the window displayingdata.</ul><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C13"><b>What are plug-ins?</b></A><P>Plug-in modules are software programs that extend the capabilities ofNetscape. A plug-in is installed on your hard disk using instructionsthat come with the plug-in. After installation, Netscape uses theplug-in's capabilities like other built-in Netscape features.<P>The plug-in application programming interface (API) allows thirdparties to extend Netscape with native support for new data types andadditional features. Plug-ins are dynamic code modules, native toeach Netscape platform. Plug-ins are complementary to architecturessuch as OLE and platform-indepen
