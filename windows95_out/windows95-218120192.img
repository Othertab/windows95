Clientcomputers use browser software (such as Netscape Navigator) to viewdocuments (pages). Server computers use server software to maintaindocuments for clients to access.<P>Web documents are created by authors using a language called HTML(HyperText Markup Language) that offers short codes (also calledtags) to designate graphical elements and links. Clicking on linksbrings documents located on a server to a browser, irrespective ofthe server's geographic location. Documents may contain text, images,sounds, movies, or a combination.<P>Documents are addressed with a URL (Uniform Resource Locator or, forshort, location). Clients and servers use a document's URL to findand distinguish among documents.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C3"><b>What does each part of an Internet address mean?</b></A><P>Here's the components of the Internet address aname@aserver.com:<ul><li>aname identifies a user. <li>The @ symbol (pronounced “at”) separates the user name from thelocation of the server computer.<li>aserver.com identifies the location of the server computer.</ul>Addresses use lowercase letters without any spaces.
