omatically download (save) a file to disk and launch helperapplications that support the file's format. Most links, however,point to pages that you can bring to your screen or specificallysave on your disk.<p>The <b>File|Save as</b> menu item produces a dialog box that lets yousave the current page as a source (HTML) file or a text file on yourdisk. (On UNIX, you can also save in PostScript format.) A file savedin HTML source format retains the formatting of the original page. Afile saved in text format is presented as plain text. You can save animage file, but not a page's inline images.<p>When you view a page containing frames, the <b>File|Save Frame as</b>menu item replaces <b>File|Save as</b> and lets you save only thepage of a currently selected frame. The dialog box options for savingthe page are unchanged.<p>By using a pop-up menu item, you can save a page as a disk fileinstead of bringing the page to the screen. While pointing over alink, click on the right mouse button (on Macintosh, hold down themouse button) to pop up the menu. The <b>Save this Link as</b> itemsaves to disk (instead of bringing to screen) the page whose link youare clicking on. The <b>Save this Image as</b> item saves to disk(instead of bringing to screen) the image whose link you are clickingon.<p>Saving to disk is particularly useful for retrieving a nonformattedpage (such as a data file) not intended for viewing. You can alsoproduce the dialog box for saving a page to disk by clicking on alink with the Shift key held down (option key on Macintosh). Otherpop-up menu items let you copy page and image locations (URLs) to theclipboard.<p>After saving a file to disk, you can use the <b>File|Open File</b>menu item to display the local file as a Netscape page. (A file onyour disk is a local file; a file out on the network is a remotefile.) For GIF, JPEG, or other nontext files to appear as availablefiles in the <b>Open File</b> dialog, make sure to select "All Files"as the file type (on Macintosh, hold down the Option key whileselecting the <b>Open File</b> menu item).<p>The <b>View|Document Source</b> menu item lets you view the currentpage in HTML source format. By default, source text is displayed in awindow. On Windows and Macintosh, you can override the default sourceviewer by specifying a supporting text application (such as your wordprocessor) in the <b>View Source</b> field of the<b>General|Applications</b> panel. Subsequently, when you choose<b>View|Document Source</b>, the HTML text appears in a window ofyour selected application.<p>The <b>File|Mail Document</b> menu item produces a window that letsyou send the current page URL along with an email attachment of thepage. The <b>Window|Bookmarks</b> menu item produces a window thatlets you save page links in a file.<p>Note: Netscape software works on several computer platforms andreserves the use of a few special characters to help interpret URLs.To avoid problems, don't use the following characters whenyou create a file name:<ul><li>slash (/)<li>colon (:)<li>number symbol (#)</ul><P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C20"><FONT SIZE=+3>P</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>rinting and finding</FONT></A><P>Many of the <b>File</b> and <b>Edit</b> menu items in the Netscapeapplication work as they do on other applications. To print thecontents of the current page, choose <b>File|Print</b> or press the<b>Print</b> button in the toolbar. A <b>Print</b> dialog box letsyou select printing options and begin printing. On Windows, you canchoose <b>File|Print Preview</b> to see a screen display of a printedpage.<p>When you view a page containing frames, you'll see the <b>File|PrintFrame</b> menu item in place of <b>File|Print</b>. The command letsyou print only the page of a currently selected frame. The dialog boxoptions for printing the page are unchanged.<p>When printing a page, the Netscape application formats contentaccording to the size of the printed page rather than the size of theonscreen window. The print command rearra
