 frame alone. You can resize frames by positioning thecursor in the border between frames (the cursor changes shape) anddragging the adjacent frames to a new position. Clicking on a linkwithin a frame may affect the page within the frame, pages withinother frames, or the top-level page. Frames and the actions of theirlinks are created by page authors using HTML<li><b>Backgrounds</b><br>The background of the content area may vary according to apreference item you can set in the <b>Color</b> panel (not on UNIX).You can set the background to a default of gray, a custom color ofyour choosing, or an image file you select. You can also determine ifyour choice of background should always be used or if the backgroundtransmitted with a page should override your choice.<li><b>Location</b>/<b>Go to</b><br>The location field shows you thelocation of the current page and can be used to enter the location(the URL address) of the page you wish to go to next. The label ofthe location field reads <b>Location</b> after you bring a page. Thelabel changes to <b>Go to</b> if you enter text into the field.Pressing the return key brings the page specified in the <b>Go to</b>field and changes the label back to <b>Location</b>. On Windows, apull-down menu at the right of the field lets you choose a URL (the10 most recent locations you've entered into the field are stored asmenu items) to revisit pages.<li><b>Status message</b><br> The status message area contains text describing a page'slocation or the progress of a connection to a page. When the cursoris positioned over highlighted words (or an image) serving as a linkto a page, the status message field shows the URL that will be usedto bring the page to the screen. When the <b>Auto Load Image</b>option is unchecked and the cursor points over an image, the statusmessage shows the alternate text for the image and, if the image is alink, the URL. When the cursor points over an image with activeareas, the status messages shows the description for the active area.During connections, the status message field reports progress incontacting the URL source, loading pages, and loading inlineinformation.<li><b>Error messages</b><br>Error message result from a variety of situations. The Netscapeapplication tries to evaluate any problem you encounter and presentinformation to help you solve or circumvent it. The most common errormessages result from trying to view a page that isn't available.Often, this occurs because the server issuing the page is temporarilyshut down or too busy with other connections to handle your request.Occasionally, the page is no longer available at the specified URL.If you would like to report a problem, you should note the exactwording of the error message. The <b>Help</b> menu offers items forgiving feedback and getting support.</ul><P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C4"><FONT SIZE=+3>S</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ecurity indicators</FONT></A><P>A document has one of three security states: secure, insecure, ormixed. The most prominent security indicator, located at the screen'sbottom-left, is a doorkey on blue for secure documents and a brokendoorkey on gray for insecure documents. The secure doorkey iconvaries slightly depending on the grade of encryption: the doorkey hastwo teeth for high-grade and one tooth for medium-grade. The colorbarover the content area is blue for secure and gray for insecure. Amixed document, with insecure information omitted, is shown assecure.<P>A URL beginning with <b>https://</b> shows that the document came froma secure server. To connect to an HTTP server that offers security,insert the letter "s" so that the URL begins with <b>https://</b>.Use <b>http://</b> otherwise. Similarly, a news URL that starts with<b>snews:</b> (instead of <b>news:</b>) shows that the document comesfrom a secure news server (again, insert the letter "s" if your newsserver offers security). Use two slashes (<b>//</b>) after the colon(<b>:</b>) for news servers other than the default one. Chose the<
