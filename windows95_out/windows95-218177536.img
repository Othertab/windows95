effort required to break any given exchange of information is aformidable deterrent. Server authentication uses RSA public keycryptography in conjunction with ISO X.509 digital certificates.<P>Netscape Navigator and secure servers deliver serverauthentication using signed digital certificates issued by trustedthird parties known as certificate authorities. A digital certificateverifies the connection between a server's public key and theserver's identification (just as a driver's license verifies theconnection between your photograph and your personal identification.Cryptographic checks, using digital signatures, ensure thatinformation within a certificate can be trusted.<P>To evaluate the strategic and quantitative implications of the SSLimplementation of certification and public key technology, consultthe <b>SSL Protocol</b> specification via the <b>Help|On Security</b>menu item.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C35"><b>How can I tell when security is in effect?</b></A><P>You can tell when you have a secure connection by looking at thelocation (URL) field. If the URL begins with <b>https://</b> (insteadof <b>http://</b>), the document comes from a secure server. Toconnect to an HTTP server that provides security using the SSLprotocol, insert the letter "s" so that the URL begins with<b>https://</b>. You need to use <b>https://</b> for HTTP URLs withSSL and <b>http://</b> for HTTP URLs without SSL. A news URL thatstarts with <b>snews:</b> (the letter "s" inserted in front of<b>news:</b>) is used for a document coming from a secure newsserver.<P>You can also verify the security of a document by examining thesecurity icon in the bottom-left corner of the Netscape Navigatorwindow and the colorbar across the top of the content area. The iconconsists of a doorkey on a blue background to show secure documentsand a broken doorkey on a gray background to show insecure documents.The doorkey has two teeth for high-grade encryption, one tooth formedium-grade. The colorbar across the top of the content area is bluefor secure and gray for insecure.<P>A mixed document containing secure and insecure information isdisplayed as secure with insecure information replaced by a mixedsecurity icon. Some servers may permit you access documentsinsecurely (using <b>http://</b>) to view mixed documents in full.<P>More detailed security information can be found by choosing the<b>View|Document Info</b> menu item. Several configurablenotification dialog boxes inform you when you are entering or leavinga secure space, viewing a secure document that contains insecureinformation, and using an insecure submission process. You'll alwaysbe warned if a secure URL is redirected to an insecure location, orif you're submitting via a secure form using an insecure submissionprocess.<P>The security protocol works as an adjunct to other protocols withoutlimiting access capabilities. You can use Netscape Navigator to bringeither secure or insecure documents. Online forms can be secure ifthe submit action is an <b>https://</b> URL to a secure server.<P>You can save a secure document (though secure documents are not cachedto disk among sessions). You can also view the HTML source of asecure document. Security affects the transmission of a documentwithout affecting your ability to manipulate the document.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C36"><b>What does the Document Information page tell me?</b></A><P>Choosing the <b>View|Document Info</b> menu item produces a page witha document's structure, composition, and security status. Structureinformation contains the URLs of images contained in the document.Composition information includes location, file MIME type, source,local cache file, modification and expiration dates, content length,and charset. Security information informs you about encryption andcertification.<P><DT><b>Security status</b><DD>Tells you the security status of a document. A secure documentstates the type of public key supported and version information. Fore
