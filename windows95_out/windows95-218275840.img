he museum. On otherlocations, the last couple of letters refer to a country code.<P>What's the difference between a person's email address and a page'sURL address?<P>Not much. They both designate a location, but are used for differentpurposes. If you ask Netscape to display an email address, you'regoing to get a message that there's no page to transmit. Likewise, ifyou ask Netscape to send mail to a page's URL, the page location hasno capacity to receive your mail. See these letters <B>http</B>?That's a protocol for presenting richly formatted, multimedia pages.The protocol <B>news</B> presents pages containing Internet newsgroupmessages. Email uses yet another protocol, <B>smtp</B>, thatpresents information in the context of a personal mailbox rather thana published page.<P>So how do you remember every address?<P>Some pages I've got memorized, but Netscape has a bookmark featurethat makes memorization unnecessary. Whenever you're looking at apage, you can choose <B>Add Bookmark</B> from the <B>Bookmarks</B>menu to append the title of the page to the <B>Bookmarks</B> menu.Later, you can choose the title to bring the page. At its simplest,the bookmark feature is a menu listing of page titles associated withpage URLs. You can open the Bookmarks window to elaborate on yourlist of bookmarks. In the window you can group bookmarks in foldersthat correspond to menu headings, create multiple lists, share listswith other people, and otherwise help you keep track of a largenumber of your favorite pages.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C9"><FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>y sister, my search</FONT></A><P>How long is the handbook?<P>Too long. People have better things to do than read nonfiction. Theholier-than-thou voice of those who believe they are imparting truthsgives me the creeps. Man, there are some places in this universewhere nothing is the truth. Manual writers need to recognize thateven nouns can drip like Salvador Dali's watch.<P>Are you doing okay, Tooey? You sound a little tired<P>The Internet is big, but big unto itself is no worthy grail. Bignessis only an asset if you have proper filters to extract matters ofpersonal importance. Netscape can bring you more pages than you canassimilate in a lifetime. How are you going to spend your hoursproductively if the lyrics and harmony that enrich your life areobscured with litter and noise? I crave more from my technology thana heartless reference to a mind-numbing expanse.<P>Maybe you need a little time off. When was the last time you andMartha went away?<P>We're making plans. I've been searching the net for a sign, an omen,clues to nirvana. I checked under Netscape's <B>Directory</B> and<B>Help</B> menus. That's what people need: a direction to go androadside attractions.<P>Links to spirituality? I've looked at all of Netscape's menu items.There's <B>File</B>, <B>Edit</B>, <B>View</B>, <B>Go</B>,<B>Bookmarks</B>, <B>Options</B>, <B>Directory</B>, <B>Window</B>,and <B>Help</B>. They and their button counterparts are tools tointeract with the Internet's resources. But tools are only tools. Andthe links you find in the <B>Directory</B> and <B>Help</B> menussimply bring pages of information supplied by indexers and writerssuch as yourself. The Internet may become a reservoir of knowledgemore profound and nurturing than any modern day library, but getreal, Tooey. The net, like many of its nerdish contributors, remainscrude and raw and speckle-complected.<P>I must remember to restrain my dueling enthusiasm and vitriol. Choosingan item from the <B>Directory</B> or <B>Help</B> menu brings a page ofinformation from the Internet. These are only starting points designedto open my eyes to possibilities and opportunities. Sculpting beautyfrom the mountains of digital detritus will come with time. I think fornow I should take your suggestion and call upon Martha to walk with mein the twilight to the ice cream shop around the corner where theyouthful scoopers know us well and serve us double scoops
