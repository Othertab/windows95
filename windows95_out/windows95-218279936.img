She said you sounded a little sad.<P>I've always been a little sad, Ma. I've had this wistful look since Iwas eight years old.<P>She says you worry too much.<P>It's what I do best.<P>You need to have more fun.<P>Okay, tomorrow I'll have fun. I'll ignore my genetic predispositionto carry the weight of the world on my shoulders and let nary ananxious thought trouble me. How's your TV newsgroup doing?<P>Enough is enough with that Alaska town. I started looking at somedifferent pages. Sometimes when I click on a link, I get this messageabout a file transfer something.<P>I can tell you've spent considerable time not reading my handbook, Ma.That's okay, I understand. Instructional books induce catatonia.<P>I'm sure yours is good.<P>Don't bet the inheritance on it. Anyway, Netscape supports lots ofprotocols, which ultimately means different things happen when youclick on a link. The protocol for graphical pages, known as WorldWide Web pages, is different than the protocol for newsgroup pages.Not only do the pages look a little different, you can see thedifferent protocol name in the location field. Web pages start withthe URL code <B>http:</B> whereas news pages start with <B>news:</B>.The protocol for email is different yet. But there's even more.<P>What's the file transfer protocol do?<P>The protocol that starts with <B>ftp:</B> is designed to let youtransfer files between a remote computer and your computer. When youclick on a <B>ftp</B> link, Netscape brings a file to your computer'shard disk. Where some protocols bring pages for viewing inNetscape, <B>ftp</B> brings computer software files that resideindependently of the Netscape application. You've heard the phraseÒdownloading.Ó Well, links to <B>ftp</B> sites perform downloadingautomatically. It's the way servers on the Internet distributesoftware. Once you've made a connection to an <B>ftp</B> site,Netscape also gives you the ability to upload files from yourcomputer to the server using either a menu command or by draggingfile icons onto the Netscape window.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C11"><FONT SIZE=+3>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>rotherly morass</FONT></A><P>Ma says you lost her trying to describe <B>ftp</B>. She knows it standsfor file transport protocol, but whenever she hears about protocols shethinks she's supposed to curtsy the queen of England.<P>That's why I never bothered to mention Telnet, Gopher, Lynx, Veronica,Archie, and WAIS. Eventually, I'll get around to proxies, socks, andthe helper applications. Plus there are the powerful programmingextensions such as Java, JavaScript, and plug-ins.<P>What are those?<P>Just more peripheral stuff to learn if you want to enter the Internetgeekdom. Telnet is an application that lets you access a remotecomputer and conduct an interactive session. You exchange informationby sitting and typing UNIX commands into a blank field. Netscape letsyou run Telnet easily, but you have to know what to type to achieveany results.<P>And it goes down hill from there?<P>Gopher's another protocol that Netscape supports. Gopher serversoffer pages with menus, but they aren't as rich as Web pages. Lynx isa program for browsing among servers but, unlike Netscape, supportsonly text. Veronica is a program that searches Gopher sites. Archieis a program that searches ftp sites. WAIS is server systemspecialized for searching databases. Proxies, socks, and the helperapplications supplement the Netscape application: they are optionsthat let users adapt to particular computer configurations andsoftware requirements.<P>Netscape knows how to display most of the information on theInternet, but not everything.<P>Yeah, for example, viewing software built into Netscape displaysimages stored in the GIF and JPEG formats. But pages can containsounds or movies or compressed information that needs to be
