o seethe broadest selection of available groups. However, the number ofnewsgroups is so large that you might prefer to limit your newsgrouppane to subscribed newsgroups.<P>You can quickly access your favorite newsgroups without searchingthrough the thousands of available groups by subscribing tonewsgroups. The easiest way to subscribe to a newsgroup is to, first,display all newsgroups (choose <b>Options|Show All Newsgroups</b>) inthe newsgroup pane, then locate each newsgroup you want ready accessto and check the <b>Subscribe</b> check box beside the newsgroupname.<P>After you subscribe to your favorite newsgroups, you can choose the<b>Options|Show Subscribed Newsgroups</b> or <b>Options|Show ActiveNewsgroups</b> menu item so that, each time you open the News window,the newsgroup pane displays only your chosen newsgroups. Activenewsgroups are subscribed newsgroups that contain new messages.<P>There are alternative ways to subscribe if you know a newsgroup's URL.Each of the following displays the newsgroup name in the newsgrouppane.<ul><li>Enter the newsgroup URL in the location field of the Netscape mainwindow.<li>Choose <b>File|Add Newsgroup</b> and type the newsgroup URL in adialog box.<li>Click on a link to a newsgroup or newsgroup message.</ul>You still must check the <b>Subscribe</b> box if you want thenewsgroup to be displayed in the pane in subsequent news sessions.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C17"><FONT SIZE=+3>U</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>sing the News window</FONT></A><P>The menu items, toolbar buttons, and clickable icons in the Newswindow let you view and compose news messages in much the same way asyou do mail messages. Here are the primary difference:<ul><li><b>Organizing messages</b>: Typically, you'll organize and storeyour mail messages on your hard disk in folders you create. Newsmessages, on the other hand, are already organized and stored innewsgroups on remote servers. If you want to store news messages onyour hard disk, you'll need to explicitly save news messages usingthe <b>File|Save As</b> menu item. The News window does not offer amailbox/folder facility.<li><b>Multiple news hosts</b>: You can have multiple news hosts(though most users only need and have one), each host supplying youwith a set of newsgroups. Choose the <b>File|Open News Host</b> menuitem to display a dialog box for specifying additional news hosts inyour newsgroup pane.<li><b>Replying to messages</b>: The News window has a unique set oftoolbar buttons that include variations on how you can reply tomessages (also available through the <b>Message</b> menu). You canreply to news by sending a newsgroup message (<b>Post Reply</b>), anemail message (<b>Mail Reply</b>), or both (<b>Post and MailReply</b>).<li><b>Threaded messages</b>: By default, newsgroup messages arethreaded (replies are positioned adjacent to original messages).Toolbar buttons allow you to mark a thread or entire newsgroup asread. Like mail, you can click in the message header pane to changethe read or flagged status of individual messages.<li><b>Quantity and age of messages</b>: Newsgroups often contain alarge number of messages. Several commands help determine thequantity and age of messages that appear in the message header paneat a time. The default number of messages retrieved from the newsserver is set as a preference item in the <b>Servers</b> panel(maximum 3500). You can choose the <b>File|Get More Messages</b> menuitem to display additional messages that do not exceed the maximum.From the <b>Options</b> menu, you can choose to <b>Add from NewestMessages</b> or <b>Add from Oldest Messages</b> to specify whether abatch of messages should begin with newer or older messages first. Bydefault, newer messages are retrieved first.<li><b>Viewing messages</b>: The <b>Options</b> menu lets you choosewhether the message heading pane should <b>Show All Messages</b> or<b>Show Only Unread Messages</b> (the default). The default choicedisplays limits the message heading pane to displaying onl
