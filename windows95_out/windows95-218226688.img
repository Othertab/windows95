The Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX platforms each haveunique file and configuration requirements.<P>Some Netscape products, such as Netscape Navigator Personal Edition,provide the necessary files, configurations, and instructions for afirst-time Internet user to gain simple access through a dial-upconnection. The software helps connect you to the network of aservice provider (a company with telecommunication capabilities) thatmaintains your Internet account.<P>Other Netscape products, such as Netscape Navigator LAN Edition, arefor users who already have an Internet connection or the know-how togain access. If you are using this software and need help connectingto the Internet, you might want to ask a system administrator orknowledgeable friend, or consult one of the many Internet books thatexplain installation and configuration of Internet services for yourcomputer platform.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C5"><FONT SIZE=+3>H</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ow can Windows users install basicNetscape?</FONT></A><P>Before installing Netscape, ensure that your Winsock package isinstalled according to the package's instructions. Most packages comewith a utility application to test your Internet connection. Windows95 includes a built-in Winsock package.<P>You can obtain Netscape software from a network or on disk.

Then, run the file from DOS or Windows toself-extract the installation files for Netscape. If you obtain thesoftware on disk, you'll have the necessary installation files.<P>From Windows, locate Netscape's SETUP.EXE (or Setup) with your filemanager, then double-click on the file to install Netscapeautomatically. Netscape creates a <b>c:\netscape</b> directory and aNetscape icon group for you.<P>Your Winsock package might require running a dialer to establish anInternet connection. Once you've connected, you can run Netscape.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C6"><FONT SIZE=+3>H</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ow can Mac and UNIX users installbasic Netscape?</FONT></A><P><b>On Macintosh</b><P>Install a TCP stack and a dialer (MacTCP and MacPPP are the mostcommon) and place them in the System folder.<P>You can get Netscape software from a network or on disk.
