Press the <b>Clear MemoryCache Now</b> button to empty the cache immediately. The default is600K on Windows, 3000K on UNIX. On Macintosh, specify memory in theapplication's Get Info box.<li>The <b>Disk Cache</b> field (<b>Cache Size</b> on Macintosh)specifies the size in kilobytes of the disk cache. On Windows andUNIX, the default is 5000K. On Macintosh, the default is 1M (1000K),the size of available disk space is displayed, and you can usebuttons to adjust the cache size. Press the <b>Clear Disk CacheNow</b> button to empty the cache immediately.<li>The <b>Disk Cache Directory</b> field (<b>Cache Directory</b> onMacintosh) specifies the disk cache location. On Macintosh, click<b>Browse</b> to select a new location.<li>Select one of three radio buttons to specify how Netscape checksthe network for document revisions (so that you're brought an updatedpage from a network server rather than a potentially stale pagestored in the cache). The default choice, <b>Once per Session</b>,checks for page revisions only once during the time you start andquit the application. Choosing <b>Every Time</b> repeatedly checksfor changes when you request a page, at the cost of slowerperformance. Choosing <b>Never</b> performs no verifications, thus apage available in cache is always brought from cache.</ul><P>Netscape performs cache maintenance when you exit the applications. Ifyou find that exiting takes longer than you wish, you might remedythe problem by reducing the size of the disk cache.<P>If you find that pages that should be in cache are taking longer toappear than they should, make sure the <b>Verify Documents</b>(<b>Check Documents</b> on Macintosh) button is not set to <b>EveryTime</b>. The verification requires a network connection that takestime.<P>Note that you can always obtain document revisions by pressing the<b>Reload</b> button. Netscape checks the network server and, if thepage is unchanged, a copy is retrieved from the cache. If the pagehas changed, a copy is transmitted from the network server. If youpress the <b>Reload</b> button while holding down the Shift key(Option key on Macintosh), Netscape always retrieves a copy from thenetwork server without regard to the cache.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C14"><FONT SIZE=+3>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>etwork Preferences</FONT><FONT SIZE=+3>|C</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>onnections</FONT></A><P>The text and each image on a page are distinct files. Netscape opens aconnection to an Internet server to bring each of these files to yourscreen. Netscape can display a page's text and multiple image filessimultaneously by opening more than one connection to a server. Byspecifying a larger number of connections, you are specifying moresimultaneous connections, which can also slow down the speed of eachindividual connection.<ul><li>The <b>Number of Connections</b> (<b>Connections</b> on Macintosh)field specifies the maximum number of network connections. Thedefault is 4.</ul><P>The network buffer size determines the amount of data that can bereceived in a network data transmission. Larger buffers mean moredata, but can also saturate the computer.<ul><li>The <b>Network Buffer Size</b> field specifies the number ofkilobytes allotted in memory for network data transmissions. OnWindows, the default is 32K. On Macintosh, the default is 8K.</ul><P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C15"><FONT SIZE=+3>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>etwork Preferences</FONT><FONT SIZE=+3>|P</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>roxies</FONT>
