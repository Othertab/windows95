k.<P>The disk cache has the advantage of persistence. When you exit asession (quit the Netscape application), the memory cache is emptied,but the disk cache is maintained (and takes up space on your hard disk).<P>Sometimes a cache can get confused (such as when servers provideinaccurate page modification dates). If you suspect a cache is actingimproperly (such as providing stale pages) or just wish to free upspace, you can clear the caches by pressing the <b>Clear Memory CacheNow</b> and <b>Clear Disk Cache Now </b>buttons in the<b>Network|Cache</b> panel (<b>Clear Disk Cache Now</b> is only onMacintosh).<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C16"><b>What is the recommended size for each cache?</b></A><P>You can change the size of each cache to maximize its effectiveness. Alarger cache might increase Netscape performance, though allocating toomuch space can constrict other applications. You might try toincrease the size of the memory cache to whatever your systemroutinely has unused and increase the disk cache to between 2,000 and5,000 kilobytes (2 and 5 megabytes).<P>You might find that a large disk cache increases the time required forthe Netscape application to quit. If Netscape's cache maintenancecauses undue delay when you exit the program, consider reducing sizeof the disk cache.<P>On Windows and UNIX, cache size and location preferences are set inthe <b>Network|Cache</b> panel. An editable field in the panel allowsyou to set the directory location of the disk cache.<P>On Macintosh, the memory cache size is set in the <b>Get Info</b>dialog box: from the Finder, select the Netscape application andchoose the <b>File|Get Info</b> menu item. The disk cache size andlocation are set in the <b>Network|Cache</b> panel. A <b>Browse</b>button in the dialog box allows you to set the directory location ofthe disk cache. By default, Netscape places the Macintosh disk cacheinside the Netscape Preferences folder within the System Folder.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C17"><b>Are there any Macintosh-specific tips or tricks?</b></A><P><DT><b>Release notes</b><DD>Choose <b>Help|Release Notes</b> while running Netscape onMacintosh for new feature listings, status reports, and otherplatform-specific reference information.<P><DT><b>Bookmark folders</b><DD>You can collapse and expand Bookmark window folders by clicking onthe triangles or double-clicking on the folders. Currently, there isa limit of 80 hierarchical menus.<P><DT><b>Bookmark shortcuts</b><DD>Bookmark shortcut icons enable you to double-click on a desktopicon to open Netscape with a particular page automatically loaded.The shortcut icon functions as a stand-alone bookmark, opening theNetscape application (if necessary) and displaying on screen thepage whose URL is stored as part of the shortcut. You can store andmanipulate shortcut icons like other Finder icons.<P>To create a Bookmark shortcut, drag the page icon from the Bookmarkwindow onto the desktop. Note that you can create an HTML copy of a pageby dragging and dropping a page link onto the desktop, however a copyof a page is a text file and differs from a bookmark to a page.<P>Once you have created the Bookmark shortcut icon, you can double-clickon the icon to automatically open the shortcut page. You can alsoopen the page by dragging and dropping the icon onto the Netscapewindow. Even if the Netscape application is not running, you can dragand drop the shortcut icon on top of the Netscape application icon toopen Netscape with the shortcut page automatically loaded.<P><DT><b>More drag-and-drop support</b><DD>In addition to drag-and-drop bookmarks, you can drag a page link(URL) onto the main window to load a page. You can also drag a pagelink from your history window. Dragging and dropping a page link ontothe desktop saves the page as an HTML text file.<P><DT><b>Stop</b><DD> To interrupt the transfer of a page, press the <b>Stop</b> buttonor choose the <b>Go|Stop Loading</b> menu item.
