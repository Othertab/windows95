Those with less substantial resources,including most individuals, access the Internet via a serviceprovider. A service provider is a company that offers use of itsdedicated communication lines. If you have a modem, you can dial up aservice provider whose computers will connect you to the Internet,typically for a fee. Dial-up access means that the modem on yourcomputer can log in to another computer that is hooked up to theInternet.<P>The most popular dial-up access alternatives are shell accounts andSLIP/PPP accounts. When using a shell account, you dial into aservice provider's computer and use the UNIX operating system toindirectly connect to the Internet. With an indirect connection, yourcomputer does not interact with Internet computers. In many cases,when you download a file from an Internet site, the file is saved onthe service provider's computer rather than on your computer. Youthen have to transfer the file from the service provider's computerto your home system. Shell accounts, while limited in features, havehistorically been less expensive than direct access accounts.<P>When using a SLIP or PPP account, you dial into a service provider'scomputer and run applications that directly connect to the Internet.With a direct connection, your computer can use browsers withuser-friendly graphical interfaces to interact with Internetcomputers. A direct connection lets you download files directly toyour system from remote sites. SLIP or PPP access to the Internetoffers more performance and convenience than a shell account.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C22"><b>What are SLIP and PPP? </b></A><P>SLIP, short for Serial Line Internet Protocol, and PPP, short forPoint-to-Point Protocol, are Internet standards for transmittingInternet Protocol (IP) packets over serial lines (phone lines).Internet information is packaged into IP packets, a method forenclosing data into small, transmittable units (wrapped up on oneend, unbundled on the other).<P>A service provider might offer SLIP, PPP, or both. Your computer mustuse connection software (usually provided by the service provider)that matches the protocol of the server's connection software. PPP isa more recent and robust protocol than SLIP.<P><DT><b>CSLIP</b><DD>CSLIP, Compressed Serial Line Internet Protocol, is aversion of SLIP that supports compression.<P><DT><b>Dynamic SLIP and Static SLIP</b><DD>When you use a SLIP or PPPconnection to the Internet, your service provider's server identifiesyour computer by providing you with an IP address (a number like192.34.32.81). Using dynamic SLIP, your computer is dynamicallyallocated a temporary IP address (just for the immediate session)from a set of IP addresses maintained by the server. Using staticSLIP, your computer is allocated a one-time, permanent IP address(when your account is set up) for use in all your sessions. StaticSLIP means you have a static IP address.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C23"><b>What are TCP/IP and Winsocks?</b></A><P><DT><b>TCP/IP</b><DD>Short for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol,this is the standard communications protocol required for Internetcomputers. To communicate using TCP/IP, A PC needs a set of softwarecomponents called a TCP/IP stack (a stack is built into Windows 95).A Macintosh typically uses a proprietary software called MacTCP. MostUNIX systems are built with TCP/IP capabilities.<P><DT><b>TCP/IP Stack</b><DD>Only the PC platform requires a TCP/IP stack. To make a successfulconnection to the Internet, your PC needs application software suchas Netscape plus a TCP/IP stack consisting of TCP/IP s
