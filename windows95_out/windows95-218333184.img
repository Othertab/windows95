For example, to send email to this company, enter<b>info@netscape.com</b>.<P>You can create, edit, and store addresses, singly or in a folder list,in the Address Book window. Addresses are maintained in the AddressBook window similarly to how bookmarks are maintained in the Bookmarkwindow.<P>Commonly, you'll send mail by replying to other mail. By default, theoriginal text appears as quoted text (each line preceded by the >symbol), though you can turn this feature off in the<b>Composition</b> panel. You can also quote a message's text bychoosing the Message Composition window's <b>File|Include OriginalText</b> menu item or paste in a clipboard selection as quoted textby selecting <b>Edit|Paste as Quotation</b>.<P>Pressing the <b>Attach</b> button produces a dialog box that lets yousend email with a file attachment. An attachment is a separatedocument sent along with the email message. The dialog box buttonslet you select a page URL or a file. You can choose to send a page asis (embedded with the HTML instructions that format Internet pages)or converted to plain text. After completing the dialog box (you canlist multiple attachments), the attachment is ready to be sent alongwith your message.<P>The Mail window offers options that let you send mail immediately ordefer delivery. Typically, you'll want to send messages immediatelyif you're connected to the network. However, to reduce connectiontime, you can compose messages offline and defer sending mail untilthe next time you're connected.<P>When the Mail window's <b>Options|Immediate Delivery</b> menu item ischecked, the Message Composition window offers a <b>Send Now</b>toolbar button and menu item (<b>Send</b> button on Windows andUNIX). This allows messages you've written to be sent over thenetwork immediately. Press the <b>Send Now</b> button or choose<b>File|Send Now</b> to transmit the message and any attachments tothe recipient.<P>When the Mail window's <b>Options|Deferred Delivery</b> menu item ischecked, the Message Composition window offers a <b>Send Later</b>toolbar button and menu item (<b>Send</b> button on Windows;<b>Later</b> button on UNIX). This allows messages you've written tobe stored in your Outbox folder (deferred) until you explicitlyspecify that the contents of the Outbox be sent. Press the <b>SendLater</b> button or choose <b>File|Send Later</b> to store thecurrent message in the Outbox folder on your disk for transmission ata later time. Choose <b>File|Send Mail in Outbox</b> to distributedeferred messages.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C16"><FONT SIZE=+3>R</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>eceiving and sending news</FONT></A><P>To display the News window, choose <b>Window|Netscape News</b>. TheNews window operates similarly to the Mail window. If you skipped theprevious pages on exchanging and composing mail, you might want to goback and read these now. Like mail, you create your news messages inthe Message Composition window.<P>People post messages (send their news) to newsgroups. Throughout theInternet, you'll find the newsgroup terms "message", "posting", and"article" used interchangeably.<P>Newsgroups are organized by subject; each newsgroup has a nameintended to reflect the topic of discussion for its messages. TheUsenet is the collection of all newsgroups; it is the Internet'smultifaceted bulletin board especially designed for people tocommunicate news with one another on special interest topics.<P>The News window contains three panes: a newsgroup pane, a messageheader pane, and a message pane. Click on an item in the newsgrouppane to display a listing of messages in the message header pane.Click on an item in the message header field to display each messagein the message pane.<P>When you open the News window, the set of newsgroups you havespecified in the <b>Options</b> menu is displayed in the newsgrouppane.
