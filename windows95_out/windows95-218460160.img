</A><P>Ordinarily, the Netscape application does not require proxies tointeract with the network services of external sources. However, insome network configurations the connection between the Netscapeapplication and a remote server is blocked by a firewall. Firewallsprotect information in internal computer networks from externalaccess. In doing so, firewalls might limit Netscape's ability toexchange information with external sources.<P>To overcome this limitation, Netscape can interact with proxysoftware. A proxy server sits atop a firewall and acts as a conduit,providing a specific connection for each network service protocol. Ifyou are running Netscape on an internal network from behind afirewall, you'll need from your system administrator the names andassociated port numbers for the server running proxy software foreach network service. Proxy software retains the ability tocommunicate with external sources, yet is trusted to communicate withthe internal network.<P>Select <b>No Proxies</b>, <b>Manual Proxy Configuration</b>, or<b>Automatic Proxy Configuration</b> to designate the conduit betweenyour computer and the Internet. Users with a direct connection to theInternet should use the default, <b>No Proxies</b>. To customize aproxy configuration, choose the manual configuration and press the<b>View</b> button to display a dialog box. If you have aconfiguration file designed expressly for your proxy server, choosethe automatic configuration and provide the file's URL in theadjacent text field.<P>A single computer can run multiple servers, each server connectionidentified with a port number. A proxy server, like an HTTP server ora FTP server, occupies a port. Typically, a connection usesstandardized port numbers for each protocol (for example, HTTP = 80and FTP = 21). However, unlike common server protocols, the proxyserver has no default port. Netscape requires that for each proxyserver you specify in a <b>Proxy</b> text field, you also specify itsport number in the <b>Port</b> field.<ul><li>Text in each <b>Proxy</b> field designates the host name of eachprotocol's proxy server. (Often, a single proxy server handles thethree major protocols: HTTP, FTP, and Gopher.) This can also be anumeric IP address of the proxy server.<li>A number in each adjacent <b>Port</b> field identifies theport number used by the proxy server.</ul>Text fields for proxies and ports are offered for FTP (File TransferProtocol), Gopher, HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), Security(Secure Sockets Layer protocol), WAIS (Wide Area Information System),and SOCKS (firewall bypass software).<P>The text field <b>No Proxy for:</b>, available when viewing the ManualProxy Configuration dialog, lets you bypass the proxy server for oneor more specified local domains. For example, if you specify<ul>HTTP Proxy: <b>aserver.netscape.com</b> Port: <b>8080</b><br>No Proxy for: <b>adomain</b>,<b>bdomain</b>,<b>netscape.com</b></ul>then all HTTP requests for the <b>adomain</b>, <b>bdomain</b>, and<b>netscape.com</b> host servers go from Netscape directly to thehost (not using any proxy). All HTTP requests for other servers gofrom Netscape through the proxy server <b>aserver</b> on port<b>8080</b>, then to the host. A proxy that runs on a host serveroutside a firewall cannot connect to server inside the firewall. Tobypass the firewall's restriction, you must set the <b>No Proxyfor</b> field to include any internal server you're using. If youuse local hostnames without the domain name, you should list them thesame way. Multiple hostnames are delimited by commas and the wildcardcharacter (*) cannot be used.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C16"><FONT SIZE=+3>S</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ecurity Preferences</FONT><FONT SIZE=+3>|G</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>eneral</FONT></A><P>At the top of this panel is a setting for Java users.
