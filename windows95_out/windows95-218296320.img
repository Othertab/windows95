often you don'tneed to know a page's URL because the location information isincluded as part of a highlighted link; Netscape already knows theURL when you click on highlighted text, press an arrow button, orselect a menu item. But sometimes you won't have an automatic linkand instead have only the text of the URL (perhaps from a friend or anewspaper article).<p>Netscape gives you the opportunity to type a URL directly into thelocation text field (or the URL dialog box produced by the<b>File|Open Location</b> menu item. Using the URL, Netscape willbring you the specified page just as if you had clicked on anautomatic link. Notice that the label on the location field says<b>Location</b> after you bring a page, or <b>Go to</b> as soon asyou edit the field.<p>Here are some sample URLs:<p><b>http://home.netscape.com/index.html</b><br><b>ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/</b><br><b>news:news.announce.newusers</b><p>On Windows, the location text field offers a pull-down menu to theright of the text. The menu contains up to 10 URLs of pages whoselocations you've most recently typed into the field and viewed.Choosing a URL item from this menu brings the page to your screenagain. The URLs are retained in the menu across your Netscapesessions.<p>Netscape uses the URL text to find a particular item, such as a page,among all the computers connected to the Internet. Within the URLtext are components that specify the protocol, server, and pathnameof an item. Notice in the URL<b>http://home.netscape.com/index.html</b> that the protocol isfollowed by a colon (<b>http:</b>), the server is preceded by twoslashes (<b>//home.netscape.com</b>), and each segment of thepathname (only one here) is preceded by a single slash(<b>/index.html</b>).<p>The first component, the protocol, identifies a manner forinterpreting computer information. Many Internet pages use HTTP(short for HyperText Transfer Protocol). Other common protocols youmight come across include <b>file</b> (also known as <b>ftp</b>,which is short for File Transfer Protocol), <b>news</b> (the protocolused by Usenet news groups), and <b>gopher</b> (an alternativetransfer protocol).<p>The second component, the server, identifies the computer system thatstores the information you seek (such as <b>home.netscape.com</b>).Each server on the Internet has a unique address name whose textrefers to the organization maintaining the server.<p>The last component, the pathname, identifies the location of an itemon the server. For example, a pathname usually specifies the name ofthe file comprising the page (such as <b>/welcome.html</b>), possiblypreceded by one or more directory names (folder names) that containthe file (such as <b>/home/welcome.html</b>).<p>Some pathnames use special characters. If you are typing a URL intothe location field, you'll need to enter the characters that exactlymatch the URL. For example, some pathnames contain the tildecharacter (~) which designates a particular home directory on aserver.<p><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C3"><FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>inding, starting and stoppinglinks</FONT></A><P>A link is a connection from one page to another. You find a link bylooking for one or more words highlighted with color, underlining, orboth in the content area of a page. Images and icons with coloredborders also serve as links. When the mouse cursor points over alink, the URL location of the link appears in the status field. Alink within a page that contains frames can be a connection thatbrings one or more new pages within frames, or an entirely newtop-level page replacing all frames.<p>You can bring a linked page to your screen by clicking once on thehighlighted text, image, or icon. Clicking on a link transfers pagecontent from a server location to your location. After you click on alink, the Netscape status indicator animates to show you that thetransfer of the page to your computer is in progress. You can stop atransfer in progress by pressing the <b>Stop</b> button or choosi
