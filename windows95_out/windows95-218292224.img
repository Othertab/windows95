tory items in the <b>Go</b> menu display pages you have viewedbefore.<li>Bookmarks items in the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu display pages youhave designated as worthy of easy access.<li>Directory items in the <b>Directory</b> menu display pages that helpyou use Netscape and Internet features.</ul><p>Ideally, the act of finding pages becomes secondary to what you reallycare about: the page's content. Like pages of a magazine, you'll wantto flip from one screen page to another, sometimes to continue withthe same article and other times to begin a new article. But youcan't hold screen pages in your hands like you can a magazine. Screenpages are rarely uniform in length and, displayed one page at a time,don't provide intuitive feedback on where the information begins andends.<p>So even though Internet pages bring information to you rathergloriously, there is something distinctly uncomfortable about contentthat continues over numerous links to pages of varying lengths.Anyone who has witnessed a slide show of a neighbor's family vacationcan identify with the queasy sensation of boundlessness.<p>Readers of electronic pages need tools to keep track of pages. TheNetscape text fields, toolbar buttons, and menu items provideyou with the ability to manage pages of information that mightotherwise leave you feeling overwhelmed and unfocused. Each time youopen the Netscape window (you can have multiple Netscape windows openconcurrently), you begin a new session of Internet interaction.<p>The author of a page supplies the content you initially see. Sometimesthe content is presented as a single unit taking up the entirecontent area of the window. Other times the content is displayed inmultiple rectangular frames that, together, form a patchwork ofindividual pages that fills the content area. Each frame can containscroll bars to let you view more information. Netscape allows you toresize any frame by positioning the mouse in the borders betweenframes (the cursor changes shape), then dragging the frame to a newsize.<p>A frame within a page is, in essence, a smaller page within a largepatchwork page. Each frame has characteristics of a page. Together,the frames form a top-level page (also called a frameset). Forexample, clicking on a link within a frame can bring new informationwithin the frame or to a different frame. Likewise, a link can bringan entirely new top-level page replacing all the frames.<p>When viewing a page with frames, certain menu items change to reflectthat actions affect only a selected frame's page and not the set ofpages in the top-level page. The <b>Mail Document</b>, <b>Saveas</b>, and <b>Print</b> menu items change to <b>Mail Frame</b>,<b>Save Frame as</b>, and <b>Print Frame</b>, respectively. When youselect a frame by clicking within it, other functions such askeyboard shortcuts affect only the contents of the frame.<p>Some pages and frames have the capability to automatically updatethemselves. Pages that have server-push and client-pull capabilitiescontain instructions that allow multiple interactions with the servercomputers. You can always terminate these automatic actions by goingto another page or otherwise exiting the page.<P>To open a new Netscape window, choose the <b>File|New Web Browser</b> menuitem. The new window brings another copy of your home page to screenin a fully functional and independent Netscape window. You can havesimultaneous network connections.<p><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C2"><FONT SIZE=+3>K</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>nowing that every page has aunique URL</FONT></A><P>To understand how a single page is kept distinct in a world ofelectronic pages, you should recognize its URL, short for UniformResource Locator. Every page has a unique URL just like every personhas a unique palm print. (Arguments persist as to which is morecryptic.)<p>A URL is text used for identifying and addressing an item in acomputer network. In short, a URL provides location information andNetscape displays a URL in the location field. Most
