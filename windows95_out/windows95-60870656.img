; assign the first received IP address to a variableszAddress = getipgoto labelJumps to the location in the script specified by label and continues executing the commands following it.Example:  waitfor "Prompt>" until 10  if !$SUCCESS then	goto BailOut	; jumps to BailOut and executes commands 			; following it  endif  transmit "bbs^M"  goto EndBailOut:  transmit "^M"haltStops the script. This command does not remove the terminal dialog window. You must click Continue to establish the connection. You cannot restart the script.if condition then		commands	endifExecutes the series of commands if condition is TRUE.Example:if $USERID == "John" then	transmit "Johnny^M"endiflabel :	Specifies the place in the script to jump to. A label must be a unique name and follow the naming conventions of variables.set port databits 5 | 6 | 7 | 8Changes the number of bits in the bytes that are transmitted and received during the session. The number of bits can be between 5 and 8. If you do not include this command, Dial-Up Networking will use the properties settings specified for the connection.Example:	set port databits 7set port parity none | odd | even | mark | spaceChanges the parity scheme for the port during the session. If you do not include this command, Dial-Up Networking will use the properties settings specified for the connection.Example:	set port parity evenset port stopbits 1 | 2Changes the number of stop bits for the port during the session. This number can be either 1 or 2. If you do not include this command, Dial-Up Networking uses the properties settings specified for the connection.Example:	set port stopbits 2set screen keyboard  on | offEnables or disables keyboard input in the scripting terminal window.Example:	set screen keyboard onset ipaddr stringSpecifies the IP address of the workstation for the session. String must be in the form of an IP address.Examples:szIPAddress = "11.543.23.13"set ipaddr szIPAddressset ipaddr "11.543.23.13"set ipaddr getiptransmit string [ , raw ]Sends the characters specified by string to the remote computer. The remote computer will recognize escape sequences and caret translations, unless you include the raw parameter with the command. The raw parameter is useful when transmitting $USERID and $PASSWORD system variables when the user name or password contains character sequences that, without the raw parameter, would be interpreted as caret or escape sequences.Examples:transmit "slip" + "^M"transmit $USERID, rawwaitfor string [ , matchcase ] [ then label 	{ , string [ , matchcase ] then label } ]	[ until time ]Waits until your computer receives one or more of the specified strings from the remote computer. The string parameter is case-insensitive, unless you include the matchcase parameter.If a matching string is received and the then label parameter is used, this command will jump to the place in the script file designated by label.The optional until time parameter defines the maximum number of seconds that your computer will wait to receive the string before it execute the next command. Without thisparameter, your computer will wait forever.If your computer receives one of the specified strings, the system variable $SUCCESS is set to TRUE. Otherwise, it is set to FALSE if the number of seconds specified by time elapses before the string is received.  Examples:waitfor "Login:"waitfor "Password?", matchcasewaitfor "prompt>" until 10waitfor	"Login:"	then DoLogin,	"Password:"	then DoPassword,	"BBS:"		then DoBBS,	"Other:"	then DoOther  until 10while condition do		commandsendwhileExecutes the series of commands until condition is FALSE.Example:integer count = 0while count < 4 do	transmit "^M"	waitfor "Login:" until 10	if $SUCCESS then		goto DoLogin	endif	count = count + 1endwhile	...9.0   Reserved WordsThe following words are reserved and may not be used as variable names.	and		boolean		databits		delay		do		endif		endproc		endwhile
