You can set this pattern by choosing theControl Panels|Desktop Patterns desk accessory, scrolling to apattern, holding down the Option key, and clicking on the <b>SetUtilities Pattern</b> button. The utilities pattern is displayedoutside the content area once you restart the Netscape application.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C4"><FONT SIZE=+3>G</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>eneral Preferences</FONT><FONT SIZE=+3>|F</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>onts</FONT></A><P>Netscape lets you choose a character set encoding's font display andspecify a document's character set encoding. An encoding represents amapping of glyphs (such as character symbols) to computer codes (suchas hexadecimal digits).<P>Each character set encoding from the <b>For the Encoding</b> pull-downmenu is associated with the display of a proportional and fixed fontpair. You can view or modify the association for any encoding bychoosing the encoding name from the menu, then choosing items fromthe proportional and fixed font pull-down menus. For example, thedefault encoding, Latin1, is associated with the proportional fontTimes 12 and the fixed font Courier 10.<P>Most pages display text in a proportional font. The <b>Use theProportional Font</b> field specifies the font of the primary type oftext in the content area. Click the <b>Choose Font</b> button (fontand font size fields are pop-up menus on Macintosh) to select analternative font or font size display. You can make a selection foreach encoding.<P>Fixed font text is used in editable fields and certain paragraphspreformatted by the author of a page. The <b>Use the Fixed Font</b>field specifies the font of the secondary type of text in the contentarea. Click the <b>Choose Font</b> button (font and font size fieldsare pop-up menus on Macintosh) to select an alternative font or fontsize display.You can make a selection for each encoding.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C5"><FONT SIZE=+3>G</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>eneral Preferences</FONT><FONT SIZE=+3>|H</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>elpers</FONT></A><P>Choose the <b>Help|Release Notes</b> menu item for platform-specific detailsand to find sites for downloading helper application software.<P>The Netscape application brings files to your computer using variousserver protocols such as HTTP, NNTP, SMTP, and FTP. Each protocol cansupport different file formats. Netscape has the built-in capabilityto interpret and display on your computer several formats, includingthe HTML format used by HTTP servers. When the Netscape applicationretrieves a file with a format that Netscape itself cannot read, theapplication attempts to use an external helper application capable ofreading the file.<P>The Helpers dialog box lets you examine and configure how a file'sformat maps to a helper application. The dialog box contains severalfields and buttons to specify MIME file types (a method ofdifferentiating file formats using a suffix appended to a file name),helper applications, and associated actions.<P>A scrolling text field lists the helper applications available to theNetscape application. Each line of the text field containsinformation about one helper application. By clicking on a line inthe text field, you can see and modify preferences for the selectedhelper application in the area below the scrolling field.<P>Below the helper applications listing are text fields and buttons thatallow you to configure new helper applications or reconfigure currentones. You can add or modify information such as file extensions oractions associated with a helper application, then click <b>OK</b>(or <b>Apply</b>) to update the contents of the scrolling field.<ul><li>The <b>File/MIME Type</b> field specifies the file or MIME type ofthe selection.<li>The <b>Subtype</b> field further classifies the technical format ofthe selection.<li>The <b>File Extensions</b> (<b>Extensions</b>) on Macintosh) fieldspecifies the available suffix or suffixes used by
