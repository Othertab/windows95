You can select from<b>Automatic</b>, <b>Dither</b>, or <b>Substitute Colors</b>. Thedefault, <b>Automatic</b>, attempts to determine the most appropriatetype of image display. Alternatively, you can select <b>Dither</b> or<b>Substitute Colors</b> to most closely match the computer'savailable colors. Dithered images may offer a closer match to animage's intended colors, but take longer to display.<P>Select <b>While Loading</b> or <b>After Loading</b> to display imagesincrementally while the image is transmitted, or all at once afterthe transmission. The <b>While Loading</b> option provides thebenefit of feedback as the transmission progresses. On a fastnetwork, the <b>After Loading</b> option might complete the loadslightly faster. The default is <b>While Loading</b>.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C7"><FONT SIZE=+3>G</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>eneral Preferences</FONT><FONT SIZE=+3>|L</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>anguage</FONT></A><P>Netscape lets you inform servers of your language priorities. (Thispreference panel is on Windows and Macintosh only.) When you requesta page, your language priorities are sent as part of the request (inthe HTTP header). Servers that have the capability to send you a pagein more than one language can interpret your language priorities andrespond to your request accordingly.<P>A language request entry consists of language code and, sometimes, aregion code. For example, the code <b>en-US</b> represents theEnglish language in the United States region; the code <b>fr-CA</b>represents the French language in the Canada region. The built-incodes are standard ISO language tags.<P>Many language and region codes are built in and specified in the<b>Request Language|Region</b> field.
