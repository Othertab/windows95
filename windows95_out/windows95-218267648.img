e with pictures and art as colorful as any magazine. Links you seeon one page help transmit to you related information that's onanother page. You just click on colored words or pictures and, zoom,another page, linked to the one you're seeing, comes flying into yourcomputer from the Internet. These interconnected pages aredistributed on server computers all over the world and Netscape isthe software that brings them to you.<P>Who makes the pages and, if they're on servers all over the world,who makes the links between the pages?<P>That's exactly what everyone is trying to figure out. Right now,pages are made by a bunch of Internet geeks who know how to getinformation inside these server computers. But that's about tochange. More and more, pages and their links are going to bepersonalized so that every individual can find the information theywant and publish information for others.<P>Do you like the people at your company?<P>So far. They seem cool: intense programmers, torn jeans and t-shirts,working through the night, alternative rock, 3 AM trips to Denny's. Idoubt we'll have the same problem as when I contracted for the PaganAxle Research Center, you know, where their chief of engineering wasdetained by the county for loudly explaining his proof of Fermat'sLast Theorem to a barbershop pole..<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C5"><FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>y sweetie</FONT></A><P>Hey, pumpkin-girl. Are you free tonight?<P>For you, yes.<P>I was thinking of coming home early from work. Say, nine tonight. Youwant to come over?<P>How about if you come here?<P>Certainly.<P>Are you going to show me what's interesting on the Internet?<P>I'd rather drown in a bowl of cabbage soup than disappoint you.<P>You haven't yet. You know, your Mom called this morning. She asked foryou, but I think she wanted to talk to me. She also wanted to knowhow to find the Internet discussion group about Northern Exposure. Itold her about news and newsgroups, the Internet's bulletin boardsystem. For an example, I had her type <B>news:alt.tv.*</B> in thelocation field. After reminding her to press the return key, she gotthe News window listing all the <B>alt.tv</B> newsgroups and, sureenough, she scrolled down and found the<B>alt.tv.northern-exposure</B> link. Apparently, spent the rest ofthe afternoon reading news messages describing the show's plots,personalities, and demise in more detail than any TV show deserves.She called back an hour ago marveling at the thread that analyzed theparallel between Northern Exposure and Green Acres: city transplantenveloped in rural lore.<P>My mom is talking about threads? Where did she pick that up?<P>She wanted to know why the titles of some messages were indented inoutline format. I told her the indented items were responses, andresponses to responses, to mirror a conversation. I told her a threadis Internet parlance for a conversation and that you could follow athread by pressing the <b>Next</b> button. Or jump to the next thread bypressing the <b>Thread</b> button. Your mom is on the net.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C6"><FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ho calls?</FONT></A><P>Ma, Martha told me you called the other morning. You know I'm neverawake in the mornings.<P>Maybe I wanted to talk to Martha. She told me about the alternativenewsgroups. Why do they call them alternative?<P>You don't want to know, Mom.<P>Oh, I saw all the newsgroups with the strange names. I would neverread those.<P>Me neither. There are plenty of other great <B>alt</B> groups. Andthereare tons of other categories besides <B>alt</B>. There's <B>rec</B> forrecreation, <B>sci</B> for science, <B>biz</B> for business, andhundreds more. Martha said you liked the Northern Exposure messages.<P>I sent one in myself. I pressed the <B>Post Office</B> button andmaileda letter. It got me wondering: Which newsgroup is your book in? None ofthe pages in the Northern Exposure newsgroup had nice pictures likeyour book.<P>I think
