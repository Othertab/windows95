b>View|Document Info</b> menu item for security details.<P>A secure document can only have inline information from securesources. The insecure information on a mixed security document isreplaced by a mixed security icon. Bringing a mixed security documentto screen produces a notification dialog.<P>If a form appears on a secure page that has an insecure submitprocess, a notification dialog always appears. The warning statesthat although the document is secure, the submission you are about tomake is insecure and could be compromised by a third party. If youare sending passwords, credit cards numbers, or other information youwould like to keep private, it would be safer for you to cancel thesubmission.<P>If an insecure document contains secure information (either inline oras part of a form), no special action is taken. The document isconsidered insecure. This includes insecure forms with securesubmission processes.<P>Several notification dialog boxes inform you about the security statusof documents. You can choose whether or not to receive these dialogsby setting the panel items in <b>Options|Security|Alerts</b> (orby unchecking a dialog's <b>Show this Alert Next Time</b> box).<P><b>Notification dialog boxes</b><ul><li>When entering a secure document space, you are notified thesecure document is encrypted when transferred to you and anyinformation you send back is also encrypted.<li>When leaving a secure document space, you are notified theinsecure document could be observed by a third party when transferredto you and any information you send back could also be read by athird party.<li>When viewing a document with a mix of secure and insecureinformation, you are notified the secure document that you justloaded contained some insecure information that will not be shown.<li>When you submit a form using any insecure submit process, youare notified the submission process you are about to use is insecure.This means that the information you are sending could be compromisedby a third party.<li>You will always be notified if the document was expected to bea secure document but is actually an insecure document (the documentlocation has been redirected to an insecure document). This meansthat a third party could observe the document you are about tobring.</ul><P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C5"><FONT SIZE=+3>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ocument information</FONT></A><P>To view elements of a document's structure, composition, and securitystatus, choose View|Document Info.
