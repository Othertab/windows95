Youcan use this command to choose landscape printing (across the longside of paper) instead of the more common portrait orientation.<p>To cut, copy, and paste, choose the respective items from the<b>Edit</b> menu. Note that <b>Cut</b> and <b>Paste</b> items areonly effective in certain editable fields. The content area is aread-only field that only enables you to select and copy text for useelsewhere.<p>To find a word or phrase within a page, choose <bEdit|Find</b> orpress the <b>Find</b> button in the toolbar. A <b>Find</b> dialog boxlets you enter the string of characters you wish to find. Checkthe <b>Match case</b> radio button (<b>Case Sensitive</b> on theMacintosh and UNIX) to require capital letters to match.<P>On Windows, check the <b>Up</b> or <b>Down</b> radio button to directthe search toward the beginning or end of the document. If there is acurrent selection, the search begins at the selection and does notwrap around.

Security issues arise because informationtravelling on the Internet usually take a circuitous route throughseveral intermediary computers to reach any destination computer. Theactual route your information takes to reach its destination is notunder your control.<P>As your information travels on Internet computers, any intermediarycomputer has the potential to eavesdrop and make copies. Anintermediary computer could even deceive you and exchange informationwith you by misrepresenting itself as your intended destination.These possibilities make the transfer of confidential informationsuch as passwords or credit card numbers susceptible to abuse.<P>The Netscape application and Netscape server use patented RSA publickey cryptographic technology and custom software to allow you to sendand receive information securely. The security protocols are open.<P>Only your computer and the server can encrypt and decrypt yourinformation. In transit, the information is an unreadable jumble. Anintermediary can continue to route the data, and even make copies ofit, but the information cannot be decrypted and remains private andsafely communicated.<P>As part of the cryptographic technology, the Netscape application andNetscape server are able to authenticate Internet servers. Thisprevents an intermediary computer from posing as your destination.<P>Not all exchanges of information are secure. Netscape uses graphicalelements and dialog boxes to inform you when you are interacting withsecure and insecure server sites.<ul><li>A URL that begins with <b>https://</b> (instead of<b>http://</b>)indicates that a document comes from a secure server. Similarly, anews URL that begins with <b>snews:</b> (instead of <b>news:</b>)indicates that a document comes from a secure news server. To accessnews servers other than the default news server, use two slashes(<b>//</b>) after the colon (<b>:</b>).<li>To the left of the status message, a doorkey icon on a bluebackground indicates a secure document (a document is a slightlybroader term for a page and its contents); a document with a brokendoorkey icon on a gray background indicates an insecure document.<li>Above the content area, a blue colorbar indicates a securedocument; a gray colorbar indicates an insecure document.<li>Dialog boxes alert you to changes in security status among thedocuments you bring to screen.
