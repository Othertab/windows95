you mean the <B>Send</B> button, but hey. My book isn'tin a newsgroup. When you looked at my book and then looked at anewsgroup, you were exploring two different areas of the Internet. Mybook lives in the area that supports excellent pictures and sounds andmovies. The newsgroups live in an area that supports easyback-and-forth communication. Maybe one day the areas will merge, butright now the Internet is specialized, not geographically, butaccording to protocols.<P>Who calls?<P>Protocols. Oh, never mind. The Internet brings you different kinds ofpages. Some, like the pages of my book, have the characteristics ofglossy magazines with clever links. Others, like the newsgroup pages,resemble a community bulletin board posted with everybody's news andopinions. Netscape brings you pages of either kind. You haven't readmy manual yet, have you?<P>Not yet, Tooey. But I will. I promise. Did you know a universityprofessor wrote in to ask who was the Northern Exposure equivalent ofArnold Ziffel? Someone responded the moose, but I think the answergoes deeper than that.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C7"><FONT SIZE=+3>B</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>rother</FONT></A><P>Hey.<P>Hey.<P>You're writing again.<P>Yup. Someone's got to explain every arrogant, assaulting acronym theindustry has come up with in the last twenty years. Unless you've setup your <B>smtp</B> and <B>nntp</B> servers, are comfortable using<B>telnet</B>, can <B>ftp</B> <B>binhex</B>, <B>gif</B>, and<B>jpeg</B> files, know the <B>url</B> of my <B>http</B> site, and wantto read my <B>html</B> pages on <B>www</B>.<P>You're working with a bunch of sick puppies. You know, the hospitalhere has got an Internet connection. Should we be using yoursoftware?<P>You bet. I've got Mom reading Web pages and newsgroups. I'm holdingoff telling her about email because I'm afraid she'll expect me towrite to her.<P>You're too late. She sent me email last night. She has discoveredthat Netscape is a full-fledged electronic mail application andnewsreader program in addition to a Web browser. Now she's asking fora built-in Netscape screen saver.<P>What? Mom's complaining about features?<P>Look, you were the one who bought her the computer. I suggested taichi lessons.<P>I guess Mom has filled you in then. Netscape software supports a bunchof protocols with a single point-and-click interface. Foremost,there's World Wide Web hypertext support for reading multimedia pageslike my handbook. Then there's a built-in Internet newsreader thatfollows threads and allows you to post your own messages. There is,as Mom pointed out, full email capabilities that let you compose,send, and receive email over the net. Plus, there's a bunch more.You can transport files. Read Gopher menus. Search databases. RunJava applets. Program in JavaScript. Hey, Netscape takes virtuallyeverything on the Internet and presents the information on a page. Toview more information, you click on a link, a button, or a menu item.It's almost that simple and is evolving into the jack-of-all-tradesInternet application.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C8"><FONT SIZE=+3>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ad discovers bookmarks</FONT></A><P>Hey, Dad. Check this out.<P>Whoa. They let you do that?<P>This page is from the Museum of Modern Art. There's no single "they"in the Internet. The closest thing to a "they" in the Internet is thegroundswell of users who voice opinions to those who abuse thefrontier spirit of interconnected computers. These scanned museum artpieces are well within the bounds of net etiquette. On the otherhand, there's utter abhorrence for the huckster who sends unsolicitedadvertising.<P>How can you tell this is from the museum?<P>See this code in the location field. It's a URL, short for UniformResource Locator. Every page has a unique URL that serves as itsaddress.
