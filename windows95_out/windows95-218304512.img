nu item shows you how the history lineageis maintained.<li>Bookmark items from the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu display pages ofyour choice. You can add a bookmark menu item for the page you areviewing by choosing <b>Bookmarks|Add Bookmark</b>. The<b>Window|Bookmarks</b> menu item lets you establish lists ofbookmarks for yourself and to share with others.<li>Items from the <b>Directory</b> and <b>Help</b> menus display pageswith up-to-date information on Netscape software and Internetexploration.<p>A pop-up menu offers utility features and a shortcut for certainlinks. On Windows and UNIX, you can click on the right mouse buttonto produce the pop-up menu (on Macintosh, press and hold down themouse button). When the mouse button is pressed over a link or image,pop-up menu items let you go to pages, view individual images, savefiles onto your disk, copy locations to the clipboard, and performother tasks. On the Windows 95 version, the pop-up menu item<b>Create Shortcut</b> lets you create Internet shortcut icons thatyou can place on the desktop or in any folder. Clicking on an Internetshortcut icon automatically opens the Netscape application and loadsa particular page.</ul><P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C5"><FONT SIZE=+3>U</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>sing history and bookmarklists</FONT></A><P>When you pull down a menu that contains history or bookmark items, yousee a list of page titles. To bring a page to your screen, choose thetitle of the page.<P>History items let you quickly retrieve pages that you've recentlyviewed in your current session. Only a single lineage of historyitems is displayed.<P>For example, a series of pages containing maps might show youincreasing detail as you click on links. If you view consecutivelylinked pages with titles North America, United States, Pennsylvania,and Philadelphia, you'll see all four items appear in the historylist with Philadelphia topmost in the list.<P>Furthermore, if you back up to the United States page, then view pagesof California and San Francisco, California and San Franciscoautomatically replace Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. The new line oflinks replaces the old line of links.<P>Bookmarks items offer a more permanent means of page retrieval. Onceyou add a bookmark to your list, the title stays until you remove itor change lists. The permanence and accessibility of bookmarks makethem invaluable for personalizing your Internet access.<P>Because bookmarks offer such ease of retrieval, the Netscapeapplication offers many options for creating a bookmark list. Basicoptions let you add access to a page through a menu item. Moreadvanced options let you create hierarchical menus, partial menudisplays, multiple and shared bookmark files, list descriptions, andlist searches.<P>The Bookmarks window, displayed by choosing the<b>Window|Bookmarks</b> menu item, gives you tools to manage bookmarklists. These tools might differ slightly depending on the platform youare using.<P>You'll find bookmarks and folders (a folder represents a hierarchicalmenu header) arranged like files and folders on your hard disk. Youcan double-click bookmarks to access pages, drag-and-drop icons toarrange your bookmarks, and use bookmark menu items to create newbookmark items and manipulate bookmark lists.<P>For example, to create a hierarchical menu, choose <b>Item|InsertFolder</b> from the Bookmarks window, give the  folder (header) aname in the dialog box, close the dialog, then drag a bookmark intothe resulting folder.<P>Don't let the advanced features dissuade you from the basicfunctionality of bookmarks. At its simplest, you can choose the<b>Bookmarks|Add Bookmarks</b> menu item to add the current page toyour bookmark list, giving you direct access to your favorite pages.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C6"><FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>hoosing the screen look</FONT></A><P>You can tailor the look of the Netscape application by showing orhiding certain graphical elements on the screen.
