 name of alocation contains at least a string and, typically, a three-lettersuffix, set apart by a dot (the period symbol is pronounced “dot”).The name of a location might require several subparts to identify theserver (a host name and zero or more subdomains), each separated bydots. For example, the address <b>aname@aserver.bserver.com</b> uses asubdomain.<P>The three-letter suffix in the location name helps identify the kindof organization operating the server. (Some locations use atwo-letter geographical suffix.) Here are the common suffixes andorganizational affiliation:<ul><li><b>.com</b> (commercial)<li><b>.edu</b> (educational)<li><b>.gov</b> (government)<li><b>.mil</b> (military)<li><b>.net</b> (networking)<li><b>.org</b> (noncommercial)</ul>Email addresses from outside the United States often use a two-lettersuffix designating a country. Here are some examples:<ul><li><b>.jp</b> (Japan)<li><b>.uk</b> (United Kingdom)<li><b>.nl</b> (The Netherlands)<li><b>.ca</b> (Canada)</ul><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C4"><b>What's the purpose of server push and client pull?</b></A><P>Generally, pages are brought to your screen as a result of your input.You click on a link or an image to request a page. But servers alsohave the ability to automatically deliver an updated version of apage to your screen. For example, a weather watcher might want to seean updated satellite photo at 15-minute intervals. Netscape providesthe pages creators and server administrators two complementary toolsfor making this work.<P><DT><b>Server push</b><DD>The server transmits page information to your screen. The Netscapeapplication displays the information and leaves the connection tothe server open. With an open connection, the server can continue topush updated pages for your screen to display on an ongoing basis.You can close the connection by closing the page.<P><DT><b>Client pull</b><DD>The server transmits page information to your screen along withprogramming code that automatically instructs the Netscapeapplication to perform an action such as "reload this page in tenminutes" or "go load this URL in two minutes." After the specifiedamount of time has elapsed, the client (the Netscape application onyour computer) pulls updated pages to your screen according to theinstructions that have been provided along with the page. You canterminate the page's actions by closing the page.<P>In server push, a HTTP connection is held open for an indefiniteperiod of time (until the server is finished sending data to theclient or until the client interrupts the connection). In clientpull, a HTTP connection is never held open; rather, the client istold when to open a new connection and what data to fetch. Serverpush uses a variant of the MIME message format "multipart/mixed" thatlets a single message (or HTTP response) contain many data items.Client pull uses an HTTP response header (or equivalent HTML tag)that tells the client what to do after a specified time delay.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C5"><b>How do I learn to write HTML and publish pages?</b></A><P>You can write HTML (HyperText Markup Language) pages using any wordprocessor or text editor. To publish pages on the Internet, you needto submit your pages to a server (a networked computer running serversoftware). HTML uses embedded codes (tags) to designate graphicalelements and links. These codes can be produced simply from yourkeyboard using angled brackets and the slash character. For example,the tag <b>&lt;B&gt;</b> presents text in bold letters. An HTMLsource file containing the expression <b>&lt;B&gt;This standsout.&lt;/B&gt;</b> is displayed on screen in bold. Notice that thetag <b>&lt;/B&gt;</b> is required to notate the end of the boldexpression.<P>HTML consists of many such tags, including tags for big headlines,underlining, italics, titles, paragraph breaks, images, and links.Choose the <b>Help|How to Create Web Services</b> menu item for linksto online HTML tutorials (or find an HTML
