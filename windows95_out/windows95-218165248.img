cally provides an editable fieldfor you to enter a search string and a button for you to submit theform to the Gopher server. The search results are a Gophermenu listing items that match your search criteria.<P>Some files, such as short digital movies, require the use ofNetscape's helper applications. If available, Netscape automaticallylaunches the helper application required by a Gopher link.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C27"><b>How do I download and upload files using FTP?</b></A><P>By accessing a page whose URL begins with <b>ftp</b> (short for filetransport protocol), you can navigate directories, view files(including HTML and image files), download software, and uploadsoftware. For example, you might use links to FTP server sites fordownloading updates to Netscape and helper application software.<P>Netscape lets you access FTP servers in the same way you access WorldWide Web (HTTP) servers. However, you may find the FTP directory andcontent pages have minimal formatting. When possible, Netscape showsthe type, size, date and a short description of each file in adirectory. A directory is presented as a list of links, each linkoften preceded by a small icon indicating another directory or afile. Clicking on a directory link displays a subdirectory.Typically, at the top of a subdirectory is a link that displays theparent directory.<P>Clicking on a binary file or program automatically downloads thesoftware to a folder (designated in the <b>General|Helpers</b> panel)on your computer. After downloading, Netscape automatically looks fora suitable helper application to launch the file. If the necessaryhelper application is not available, a dialog box asks whether youwant to save or discard the downloaded software.<P>Note that not all files are downloaded using FTP. By using the pop-upmenu or by clicking on a link with the Shift key held down (Optionkey on Macintosh), you produce the dialog box for saving an HTTPpage, an image file, or other file type to disk.<P>After you have accessed an FTP server, you can upload files to thesite by dragging and dropping files from the desktop to the Netscapebrowser. Alternatively, after you've accessed an FTP site, choose the<b>File|Upload File</b> menu item. In the resulting dialog box,select the file on your hard disk that you wish to upload. Note thatyou must have write access to the FTP server (permission granted fromthe site) to upload files.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C28"><b>Where do I find helper applications?</b></A><P>Choose the <b>Help|Frequently Asked Questions</b> menu item, click onthe Netscape Navigator FAQ link, then click the System Requirementslink to find sites for downloading helper application software. Toinstall and configure helper applications (many are alreadyconfigured), choose the <b>Options|General|Helpers</b> menu item todisplay the <b>Helpers</b> panel.<P>Helper applications expand Netscape's abilities by letting youautomatically decompress downloaded applications, listen to sounds,play movies, and get better display of images. Most can be obtainedfree or as shareware.<P><b>Compression</b>: You might find that some programs are stored on theInternet in formats your computer doesn't understand. You'll want tolocate a helper application program like PKUNZIP (Windows) or StuffitExpander (Macintosh) to translate and decompress downloaded software(and other helper applications).<P><b>Sounds</b>: Most sound files aren't in a format that your computer canautomatically play. To listen to the different types of sound filessuch as ULAW (common <b>.au</b> files), AIFF, and WAV, you'll need toinstall a helper application that understands them.<P><b>Pictures and Movies</b>: Netscape can display GIF, JPEG, and XBM filesinternally, but you might prefer to use a dedicated image viewer. Tohave Netscape automatically launch an external viewer, select the<b>Mime Type</b> in the list, then choose the radio button <b>LaunchApplication</b>. (On UNIX, you'll use a <b>.mailcap</b>
