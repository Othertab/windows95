sers use hotlists similar to the way that Netscape usesbookmarks. Users of other browsers might want to preserve the URLsthey have accumulated as hotlists by converting them to bookmarks.<P>Choose the <b>Window|Bookmarks</b> menu item. Choose the<b>File|Import</b> menu item in the Bookmarks window. These commandsread any HTML file containing links and convert the links intobookmarks.<P>To import a hotlist into Netscape, you should first convert yourhotlist to HTML. Several downloadable utilities perform thisconversion. You can also use another browser's mailcommand to transmit a hotlist in HTML format.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C9"><b>How can I save files and images onto my hard disk?</b></A><P>Choose <b>File|Save As</b> to save a page locally (to your hard disk)in source, text, or PostScript format (UNIX only). Source formatproduces a text file encoded with the HTML necessary to reproduce theformatted text or image faithfully; text format saves text withoutthe HTML code. Where some links, such as many FTP links,automatically download and save a file to disk, <b>Save As</b>manually saves page files.<P>You can also save a page to disk without displaying the page onscreen.Position the mouse over a link or image, then click the right mousebutton (on Macintosh, hold down the button) to produce a pop-up menuwith the items <b>Save this Link as</b> and <b>Save this Image as</b>for saving a file. Clicking on any link with the Shift key depressed(Option key on Macintosh) also produces a save dialog.<P>Saving a file to your hard disk allows you to display the page'sinformation without any network connection. You can choose<b>File|Open File</b> to display the HTML-formatted text or graphicimage of any local file saved in source format (though a page'sinline images might be replaced with icons).<P>On Windows, you'll need to select “All Files” for GIF, JPEG, orother nontext files to show up in the <b>Open File</b> dialog. OnMacintosh, GIF and JPEG images are available in the <b>Open File</b>dialog, though for other nontext files to show up, you'll need tohold down the Option key while selecting the <b>Open File</b> menuitem.<P>The pop-up menu item <b>View this Image</b> lets you see an isolatedimage file. The pop-up menu item <b>Copy this Image Location</b>copies the URL of the image file to the clipboard. Once you have theURL, you can open the image and save the image to your hard disk insource format using <b>File|Save As</b> or the pop-up menu. You couldalso use <b>View|Document Source</b> to find the URL of an inlineimage embedded in HTML code).<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C10"><b>What is dithering and how is it used?</b></A><P>Dithering is a software imaging process for arranging adjacent pixelsof varying shades to achieve a visual effect. The process oftenenhances a computer's ability to display an image, and isparticularly useful when the color or resolution of the originalimage must be reproduced on computers with different displaycapabilities.<P>Netscape's display of inline GIF and JPEG sometimes needs to translatean image's colors into similar colors available on your computer. Ifyour computer doesn't have color capabilities that match the colorinformation in an image, the image might look speckled.<P>On Windows and UNIX, you can set radio buttons in the<b>General|Images</b> panel to <b>Automatic</b>, <b>Dither</b>, or<b>Substitute Colors</b>. JPEG images, however, are always dithered.<P>The default choice, <b>Automatic</b>, lets Netscape choose the imagedisplay determined to be most appropriate. When you choose to<b>Dither</b>, Netscape dithers the computer's available colors tomost closely match the image's colors. When you choose <b>SubstituteColors</b>, Netscape substitutes an available color that most closelymatches the image's colors. Images that are displayed with ditheringtake slightly more time to display than images using colorsubstitution.<P>On Macintosh, dithering for all images is built-in and cannot
