 Handbook tellsyou why you need security on the Internet and how to recognize thesecurity features built into Netscape Navigator.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C32"><b>Can I safely transmit information such as credit card numbers?</b></A><P>You can enter your credit card number on a secure (<b>https</b>)Netscape Navigator form and transmit the form over the Internet to asecure server without risk of an intermediary obtaining your creditcard information. The security features offered by NetscapeCommunications technology protects commercial transactions, as wellas all other communications, from misappropriation and fraud thatcould otherwise occur as information passes through Internetcomputers.<P>Secure communications does not eliminate all of an Internet user'sconcerns. For example, you must be willing to trust the serveradministrator with your credit card number before you enter into acommercial transaction. Security technology secures the routes ofInternet communication; security technology does not protect you fromunreputable or careless people with whom you might choose to dobusiness.<P>The situation is analogous to telling someone your credit card numberover the telephone. You may be secure in knowing that no one hasoverheard your conversation (privacy) and that the person on the lineworks for the company you wish to buy from (authentication), but youmust also be willing to trust the person and the company.<P>Server administrators must take additional precautions to preventsecurity breeches. To protect your information, they must maintainphysical security of their server computers and control access tosoftware passwords and private keys.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C33"><b>How does Netscape's security technology protect me?</b></A><P>The security features built into Netscape Navigator and secure serversprotect your Internet communications with:<ul><li>Server authentication (thwarting impostors)<li>Privacy using encryption (thwarting eavesdroppers)<li>Data integrity (thwarting vandals)</ul><P>Without thorough security, information transmitted over the Internetis susceptible to fraud and other misuse by intermediaries.Information traveling between your computer and a server uses arouting process that can extend over many computer systems. Any oneof these computer systems represents an intermediary with thepotential to access the flow of information between your computer anda trusted server. You need security to make sure that intermediariescannot deceive you, eavesdrop on you, copy from you, or damage yourcommunications. The Internet does not provide built-in security. <P>The SSL protocol delivers server authentication, data encryption, andmessage integrity. SSL is layered beneath application protocols suchas HTTP, SMTP, Telnet, FTP, Gopher, and NNTP, and layered above theconnection protocol TCP/IP. This strategy allows SSL to operateindependently of the Internet application protocols.<P>With SSL implemented on both the client and server, your Internetcommunications are transmitted in encrypted form. Information yousend can be trusted to arrive privately and unaltered to the serveryou specify (and no other).<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C34"><b>To what degree can SSL security protect me?</b></A><P>SSL uses authentication and encryption technology developed by RSAData Security Inc. For example, Netscape Navigator's exportimplementation of SSL (U.S. government approved) uses a medium-grade,40-bit key size for the RC4 stream encryption algorithm. Theencryption established between you and a server remains valid overmultiple connections, yet the effort expended to defeat theencryption of one message cannot be leveraged to defeat the nextmessage.<P>A message encrypted with 40-bit RC4 takes on average 64 MIPS-years tobreak (a 64-MIPS computer needs a year of dedicated processor time tobreak the message's encryption). The high-grade, 128-bit U.S.domestic version provides protection exponentially more vast. The
