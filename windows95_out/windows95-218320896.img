The Usenet news pages,designed for people to communicate with each other on specialinterests, contain forms for you to enter messages and subscribe tonewsgroups.

Whereyour World Wide Web server uses uses the HTTP protocol to transportpage information, your outgoing and incoming Internet mail serversuse mail protocols (SMTP and POP3) and your Usenet news server uses anews protocol (NNTP).<P>Do you know the name of your email servers and news server? If not,you will have to find out from your service provider, systemsadministrator, or resident know-it-all. After specifying the names ofthese servers as preference items in the <b>Servers</b> panel, Netscapesoftware lets you send and receive email and newsgroup postings.<P>Here are some of the preferences you can set in the <b>Option|Mail andNews</b> panels.<ul><li>In the <b>Servers</b> panel, specify your mail server names in the<b>Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server</b> field and the <b>Incoming Mail(POP3) Server</b> field. You should specify local mail servers, ifavailable. Often, the same server name is appropriate for both fieldsand the name can be as simple as <b>mail</b>. You should also enteryour email id (the part of your email address to the left of the @symbol; not the entire address and without the @ symbol) in the<b>POP User Name</b> field.<li>In the <b>Servers</b> panel, specify your news server name in the<b>News (NNTP) Server</b> field. You should specify a local newsserver, if available. Often, the name can be as simple as <b>news</b>.<li>In the <b>Identity</b> panel, specify your name, email address(the entire address including the @ symbol), and your reply-toaddress (if you want mail replies sent to a different address thanyour email address) in the designated fields. This and otherinformation provided in the panel establishes your identity to thosewho receive your mail and news messages.<li>In the <b>Organization</b> panel, specify whether you want mailand news messages threaded and the method messages are sorted. Bydefault, news messages are threaded and mail messages are not. Whenmessages are threaded, replies are displayed adjacent to the originalmessage and other replies to the original message. When messages areunthreaded (the box unchecked), replies are displayed according tothe sorting order without regard to the position of the originalmessage or other replies.<li>In the <b>Appearance</b> panel, specify font characteristics ofyour message text and quoted text. By default, when you reply to amessage, the original text is quoted (restated) with each linepreceded by the > symbol. You can specify the style and size of thequoted text in your messages.<li>In the <b>Composition</b> panel, specify whether you want yourreplies to automatically quote the original message, and whether youwant a copy of your messages automatically sent to yourself, sent toanother email address, or stored on a disk file.</ul><P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C13"><FONT SIZE=+3>R</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>eceiving and sending email</FONT></A><P>To display the Mail window and access email features, choose<b>Windows|Netscape Mail</b>.
