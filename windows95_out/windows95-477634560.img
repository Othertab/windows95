9.	Charges

	9.1    You agree to pay all charges (including, without limitation, the MSN member fees and any IAP access charges) for your use of MSN at the prices then in effect for your country of residence.  All MSN charges (other than IAP access charges) will be exclusive of value added ("VAT"), sales or other taxes.  MSN member fees as well as Merchant, CP and IAP charges, if applicable, will be subject to VAT, sales or other taxes as appropriate.  MSP reserves the right to change prices or institute new charges for access to or use of MSN at any time upon not less than thirty (30) days' notice to Members.  If MSP is the billing agent on access charges assessed by a third party IAP, MSN will also make available to Members notice of any change in prices or new charges instituted by an IAP for its access services at any time upon not less than thirty (30) days' notice.  All changes will be posted online, and you are responsible for reviewing pricing information posted on MSN regularly to obtain timely notice of such changes.  Continued use of MSN or non-termination of your membership after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the prices as modified by the posted changes.  Your MSN account balance may include charges incurred for your purchase of goods and services offered by Merchants, CPs or IAPs.  The payment terms applicable to such charges are as stated herein unless you are otherwise notified by MSP or the Merchant, CP or IAP from which you purchased such goods or services.  The IAP from which you purchase access services may bill you directly for its access charges.  You must pay all taxes due as a result of your use of MSN, including taxes on your purchase of goods and services from Merchants, CPs or IAPs.  VAT, sales and other applicable taxes charged will be included in the total charges listed on your online statement of MSN charges, as described in Section 10.1.
