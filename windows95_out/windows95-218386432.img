For example, you'll want to be able to distinguish old correspondencethat you've read from new correspondence that you've yet to read.<P>Some organizational tools pertain to mail or news, but not both. Forexample, to organize mail messages you can drag and drop the messagesinto mail folders. News messages, on the other hand, are alreadyorganized among newsgroups and the News window does support thedragging and dropping of messages.<P>The last sections of this chapter detail the operation of theBookmarks window and Address Book window. Bookmarks let you organizeURLs using the same drag-and-drop metaphor used to organize files inoperating systems such as those used by Macintosh and Windows 95computers. Both the Bookmarks and Address Book windows offer custommenu items to help you set up and use their features.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C2"><FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>essage Composition window </FONT></A><P>You can create and send email and newsgroup messages using the MessageComposition window. When sending email, you can transmit Internetpages and disk files as attachments, including fully formatted HTMLpages displayed within your mail message.<P>To display the Message Composition window, choose <b>File|New MailMessage</b> or <b>File|Mail Document</b>, or one of several toolbarbuttons and menu items in the Mail and News windows. You can alsodisplay the Message Composition window by clicking on a page link ora button designed to initiate email.<P>The View menu items let you hide or display numerous types of addressfields. Fields can contain more than one address.<ul><li>The <b>From</b> field shows your email address. <li>The <b>Reply To</b> field contains the email address where youwant replies to your email sent.<li>The <b>Mail To</b> contains the email address where you want yourmessage sent.<li>The <b>Mail Cc</b> field contains the email address where youwant a copy of your message sent.<li>The <b>Mail Bcc</b> field contains the email address where youwant a blind copy of your message sent. A blind copy does not displaythe address of the copy recipient<li>The <b>File Cc</b> field contains the location where you want tostore a copy of the message you're sending. By default, messages arestored in the folder specified in the <b>Mail and News|Servers</b>panel.<li>The <b>Newsgroups</b> field contains the name of the newsgroupwhere you want to post your news message. If you're posting from anewsgroup listing or message, this field is preset with the name ofthe newsgroup.<li>The <b>Followup To</b> field contains the name of the newsgroupwhere you want replies to your message posted.<li>The <b>Subject</b> field contains a description of your email orposting. If you're sending mail or posting from news messages, thisfield is preset with the name of the current page.<li>The <b>Attachment</b> field shows the page name or file name ofany attachments you've designated.</ul>Enter a message or include the text of the current page in the largemessage field. If you're sending mail, this field is preset with thecurrent page's URL. If the Mail and News|Identity panel specifies atext file containing your signature, the signature is appended.<P>On Windows, you can click on some field labels to produce the AddressBook window or Attachment file dialog to simplify text entry. OnMacintosh, you can click the small triangle icon in the upper-left ofthe window to show or hide the address and attachment fields.<P>Here are the Message Composition buttons:<ul><li><b>Send (Now)</b>, available when you check <b>Options|ImmediateDelivery</b>, distributes the current message into the network andcloses the window.<li><b>Send (Later)</b>, available when you check <b>Options|DeferredDelivery</b>, stores the current message in the Outbox folder on yourdisk for distribution into the network at a later time. Choose<b>File|Send Mail in Outbox</b> to distribute deferred messages.<li><b>Quote</b> puts the current message into the quoted text format.<li><b>Attac
