tus of the mail server. Thisappears before you've opened the Mail window or if you haven'tsupplied your password.<li>The envelope alone indicates there are no new messages for you.<li>An exclamation point (!) adjacent to the envelope indicates thatnew messages are available for retrieval. On Macintosh, you'll alsobe notified of new messages by a mail icon flashing in the menu bar.</ul>The Mail window consists of three panes: the mail folder pane, themessage header pane, and the message content pane.<P>The mail folder pane contains a hierarchical list of your mail foldersand three columns:<ul><li><b>Mail Folder</b> shows the name of the mail folder.<li><b>Unread</b> shows the number of unread messages.<li><b>Total</b> shows the number of messages within the folder.</ul>Four Netscape-generated folders can appear at the top of the list of folders:<ul><li>The Inbox folder holds incoming mail messages to you. The folderalways appears.<li>The Outbox folder holds your unsent messages. The folder iscreated when the Message Composition window's <b>Options|DeferredDelivery</b> item is checked and you specify that a message be sentlater.<li>The Sent Mail folder holds copies of your sent messages. Thefolder is created when a mail file is specified in the <b>Mail andNews|Composition</b> panel and you send a message.<li>The Trash folder holds mail messages you are deleting. The folderis created when you delete a message.</ul>Using menu items, you can add more mail folders to help organize yourmail. Any new folders you create will appear after the automaticallycreated folders.<P>When you select a mail folder by clicking on it, the message headingpane displays the titles of messages contained in that folder and thefollowing columns:<ul><li><b>Sender</b> shows the name of the sender of the mail message.<li>The Flag icon shows if the message has been marked as noteworthy.Click the icon to toggle the flag status.<li>The Read icon shows if the message has been viewed. Click the iconto toggle the read status.<li><b>Subject</b> shows the subject line of the message.<li><b>Date</b> shows the date and time the message arrived at yourInbox.</ul>You can move a message stored in one folder to another by dragging themessage icon in the message list to a message folder. You can alsouse <b>Message|Move</b> or <b>Message|Copy</b> to put messages ormessage copies inside folders.<P>Mail messages are unthreaded by default. You can change the setting inthe <b>Mail and News|Organization</b> panel. On Macintosh, themessage headings pane offers an area above the scroll bar that youcan click on to show the current headings threaded or unthreaded.<P>When you select a message heading by clicking on it, the message getsdisplayed in the message content pane along with header informationsuch as <b>Subject</b>, <b>Date</b>, <b>From</b>, <b>To</b>, and<b>CC</b>.<P>You can use toolbar buttons or menu items to move on to the nextmessage or read a previous message.<P>You can resize each of the three panes to accommodate mail informationby positioning the cursor on the border lines between two panes (thecursor changes shape) and dragging to the proportions you desire.<P>If the message sender has included a page attachment, you can checkthe <b>View|Attachments Inline</b> menu item to display fullyformatted HTML page information appended to the message body or checkthe <b>View|Attachments as Links</b> menu item to display a link tothe attached page. If the message sender has included a fileattachment, you can click on a link that presents the Save As dialogfor saving the file to your hard disk. Beside each link to anattachment, you'll find information detailing the attachment's name,file type, and encoding.<P>The Mail toolbar buttons and menu items offer further options forviewing, creating, sending, and storing mail messages.<P><HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><A NAME="C4"><FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>ail toolbar buttons</FONT></A><P><ul><li><b>Get Mail</b><br>Connect to the mai
