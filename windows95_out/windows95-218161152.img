oftware,sockets software (Winsock.DLL), and hardware driver software (packetdrivers). Several popular TCP/IP stacks are available for Windows,including shareware stacks.<P><DT><b>Winsocks</b><DD>This stands for Windows Sockets. Winsocks is a set ofspecifications or standards for programmers creating TCP/IPapplications (communicating applications such as Netscape) forWindows.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C24"><b>What should I know about firewalls?</b></A><P>A firewall protects one or more computers with Internet connectionsfrom access by external computers connected to the Internet. Afirewall is a network configuration, usually created by hardware andsoftware, that forms a boundary between networked computers withinthe firewall from those outside the firewall. The computers withinthe firewall are a secure subnet with internal access capabilitiesand shared resources not available to the computers on the outside.<P>Often, a single machine atop the firewall is allowed access to bothinternal and external computers. Since the computer atop the firewallis directly interacting with the Internet, strict security measuresagainst unwanted access from external computers are required.<P>A firewall is commonly used to protect information such as a network'semail and data files within a physical building or organizationsite. A firewall reduces the risk of intrusion by unauthorized peoplefrom the Internet, however, the same security measures can limit orrequire special software for those inside the firewall who wish toaccess information on the outside. A firewall can be configured usingproxies (or SOCKS) to designate access to information from eachside of the firewall.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C25"><b>What are proxies and SOCKS?</b></A><P><DT><b>Proxy or proxy server</b><DD>A proxy is a special server that typically runs in conjunctionwith firewall software and allows access to the Internet from withina firewall. The proxy server waits for a request from inside thefirewall, forwards the request to the remote server outside thefirewall, reads the response, then sends the response back to theclient. Netscape lets you set the name and port number of proxyservers in the <b>Network|Proxies</b> panel in order to resolverequests for access to Internet resources. Protocols such as HTTP,FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and Security can have designated proxies. Proxiesare generally preferred over SOCKS for their ability to perform caching,high-level logging, and access control.<P><DT><b>SOCKS</b><DD>SOCKS is software that allows computers inside a firewall to gainaccess to the Internet. SOCKS is usually installed on a serverpositioned either inside or on the firewall. Computers within thefirewall access the SOCKS server as clients to reach the Internet.Netscape lets you set the name and port number of the SOCKS host(server) in the <b>Network|Proxies</b> panel. On Windows, the host isspecified in the registry (32-bit) or INI file (16-bit).<P>Sometimes you need to restart Netscape after changing the SOCKS host.Netscape supports version 4 of SOCKS, defined by the socks.cstc.4.1implementation.<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%><P><A NAME="C26"><b>Why might I use Gopher?</b></A><P>Some information on the Internet is offered through Gopher servers.When you want information that happens to be on a Gopher server,you'll click on a link whose URL begins with <b>gopher</b> (or enterthe URL in the location field).<P>Netscape lets you access Gopher servers in the same way you accessWorld Wide Web (HTTP) pages. Though Gopher pages lack richformatting, menu listings allow you to display content pages oradditional menu sublistings.<P>A menu is presented as a list of links, each link preceded by a smallicon indicating the type of resource the link displays. For example,Gopher links can bring you<ul><li>menus<li>text files<li>images<li>indexes<li>movie and binary files</ul>Gopher indexes use form pages that let you find information onGopher servers.
