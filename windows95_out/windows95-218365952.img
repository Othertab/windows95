Press the <b>Find</b> button to begin the search. If amatch is found, the text is selected and, if necessary, scrolled to avisible position in the content area.

On Windows, check the <b>Up</b> or <b>Down</b> radio button todirect the search toward the beginning or end of the document. Ifthere is a current selection, the search begins at the selection anddoes not wrap around to the opposite end of the document.

Netscape checks the network server to see ifany change to the page has occurred. If there's no change, the freshcopy is retrieved from the cache. If there's a change, the freshcopy is transmitted from the network server and the reloaded pagedisplays the updated page contents. If you press the <b>Reload</b>button while holding down the Shift key (Option key on Macintosh),Netscape retrieves a fresh version from the network server regardlessof whether the page has been updated (the cache is not used).<li><b>Reload Frame</b><br>Brings a fresh copy of the currently selected page within a singleframe on a Netscape page containing frames. In other respects, thecommand operates the same as <b>Reload</b>.<li><b>Load Images</b><br>Displays images of the current Netscape page. Typically, imagesautomatically load into pages. However, if the <b>Options|Auto LoadImages</b> menu item is unchecked when a page loads, a small icon issubstituted at the position of each image. Choosing <b>LoadImages</b> replaces all small icons with their corresponding images.Images are loaded from their source files, however the page is notreloaded (links to images are not updated from the source page).<li><b>Refresh</b> (Not on Macintosh)<br>Brings a fresh copy of the current Netscape page fromlocal memory to replace the one originally loaded. The refreshed pagedoes not display changes made to the source page from the time of theoriginal loading.<li><b>Document Source</b><br>Produces a View Source window showing the current page in theformat of HTML (HyperText Markup Language). The HTML source textincludes the commands used to create the content and content style ofa single page. On Windows and Macint
